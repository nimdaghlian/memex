This was an amazing Rice Lager that [[Andrea]] made. I think it was accidentally a steam beer, which are usually ales, but this was a lager somehow. It brewed at a very high temperature in her gazebo and turned out great.

It's not really called Turd Lake, but she sent me a picture of the logo, which is a grain of rice, and I said it looked like a lake seen from above and she was like "phew, Chris said it looked like a turd."

I should stress the beer is really good, and it fermented in her gazebo. It doesn't deserve to be called Turd Lake.
