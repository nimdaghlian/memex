[[Buckmanite]], or Buckman Slate, is a metamorphic substance endemic to many urban environments, but first identified in the Buckman neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It is a composite material formed when plastic municipal containers undergo rapid exothermic reactions, deforming to bond with the surrounding environment.
