Someone has been leaving touching memorials for their son, who went by Pika, on the same pillar of the Morrison Bridge since at least 2019. This was right outside the door to my studio for years, so I did my best to document it whenever I could before the Portland graffiti removal team would paint over it. Pika, I didn't know you, but you are remembered.ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤
