It was my second spring in this building in an apartment facing that courtyard, and I’d seen hummingbirds before – even the start of another nest. But never a hummingbird in the nest. Without flowers or even buds on the maples, I didn’t expect to see much more. But there it was, an espresso-cup sized nest made of lichen, sticks, and fluff.</p>\n",

Each issue in the series describes an original imaginary land with detailed descriptions of its history, features, and creatures, but loosely enough that it can be used to play in any system you want, or just read for enjoyment. The Viridian Maw itself is “an overgrown meteor crater, mutated and reshaped by fungal influence,” and the illustrations are great. A treasured object.</p>\n",

Hardly a week had elapsed since Van’s arrival when he was found worthy of being initiated in her web of wisdom. An individual’s life consisted of certain classified things: “real things” which were unfrequent and priceless, simply “things” which formed the routine stuff of life; and “ghost things,” also called “fogs,” such as fever, toothache, dreadful disappointments, and death. Three or more things occurring at the same time formed a “tower,” or, if they came in immediate succession, they made a “bridge.” “Real towers” and “real bridges” were the joys of life, and when the towers came in a series, one experienced supreme rapture; it almost never happened, though. In some circumstances, in a certain light, a neutral “thing” might look or even actually become “real” or else, conversely, it might coagulate into a fetid “fog.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

But just as handmade pies lean on the qualities of their ingredients, even the most handmade of images are inseparable from the physical, non-human properties of the tools and materials that someone’s hands used in the making. How much we let those properties matter in our reading of an image depends on where we locate the “art” of the process; i.e. where we expect the presence of an artist doing art in a way that matters to the image.</p>\n",

It had been a long, long journey to get to our wedding, spanning multiple road trips and the first two years of the pandemic. It was very late on the night of our wedding, and we were having an emotional connection with our friend Drew, who had d.j.’d for us. I dug around in Martha’s bag to give him more money, and found this bottle cap. It was from the trip to Africa Martha took right after we first met, one of two she’d take that year, which made her seem very worldly and well-traveled to me. The Andes mint wrapper crammed in the back was unmistakably from the bottomless bowl of free Andes mints at the Roadside Attraction bar in our old neighborhood in Portland, which we hadn’t been to for years because of the Pandemic and moving way. Indellible artifacts from two different, distinct parts of our lives, both seemingly a million years gone, plinking to the floor in a moment that very concretely felt like the point on which our lives were pivoting to become something new.</p>\n",

I’m glad to have avoided developing a <em>need</em> for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I’m always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.</p>\n"
