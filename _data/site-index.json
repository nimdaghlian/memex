An individual’s life consisted of certain classified things: “real things” which were unfrequent and priceless, simply “things” which formed the routine stuff of life; and “ghost things,” also called “fogs,” such as fever, toothache, dreadful disappointments, and death. Three or more things occurring at the same time formed a “tower,” or, if they came in immediate succession, they made a “bridge.” “Real towers” and “real bridges” were the joys of life, and when the towers came in a series, one experienced supreme rapture; it almost never happened, though. In some circumstances, in a certain light, a neutral “thing” might look or even actually become “real” or else, conversely, it might coagulate into a fetid “fog.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Groups are a runtime effect.You cannot specify in advance what any given group will do, and so you can’t instantiate in software everything you expect to have happen. Now, there’s a large body of literature saying, “We built this soft-ware, a group came and used it, and they began to exhibit behaviors that surprised us enormously, so we’ve gone and documented these behaviors.” Over and over and over again this pattern comes up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets.

But just as handmade pies lean on the qualities of their ingredients, even the most handmade of images are inseparable from the physical, non-human properties of the tools and materials that someone’s hands used in the making.

I’ve been doing it since the early 2000s, making a range of choices about what constitutes a “gift” or what people “want.” I’ve mostly settled on making papercuts inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.polartcenter.com/Wycinanki-Paper-Cuts-s/169.htm\">Polish art of Wycinanki</a>, but you’ll find a few other inventions here as well.</p>\n",

It had been a long, long journey to get to our wedding, spanning multiple road trips and the first two years of the pandemic. It was very late on the night of our wedding, and we were having an emotional connection with our friend Drew, who had d.j.’d for us. I dug around in Martha’s bag to give him more money, and found this bottle cap. It was from the trip to Africa Martha took right after we first met, one of two she’d take that year, which made her seem very worldly and well-traveled to me. The Andes mint wrapper crammed in the back was unmistakably from the bottomless bowl of free Andes mints at the Roadside Attraction bar in our old neighborhood in Portland, which we hadn’t been to for years because of the Pandemic and moving way. Indellible artifacts from two different, distinct parts of our lives, both seemingly a million years gone, plinking to the floor in a moment that very concretely felt like the point on which our lives were pivoting to become something new.</p>\n",

And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets.
