TBH I'm kind of hoping that I actually don't have a good reason and it was just one of those [[Slow Motion Bullseyes]] \n\nI've really just started it, but it's pretty compelling so far. I'm automatically on board with one of the central ideas, that when we describe images we are mostly making statements about the description -- we can't assume that there's this special unbroken connection between the nature of the painting and the things we're saying about it. This is very conceptual-labor-y -- that we're working with our model of the image, and can refine it to get closer to the \"actual\" image, but never escape it.\n\nWas on my mind when writing about [[Amy Bay at Nationale]]. Thought I'd write about paint, ended up writing about what I think about paintings.",

It was my second spring in this building in an apartment facing that courtyard, and I'd seen hummingbirds before -- even the start of another nest. But never a hummingbird in the nest. Without flowers or even buds on the maples, I didn't expect to see much more. But there it was, an espresso-cup sized nest made of lichen, sticks, and fluff. \n\nSoon, we could say hi to the mom every time we left the building -- she was always on the nest. Within a week, someone had hung up a feeder.\n\n![A photo of a mother hummingbird in her nest](/assets/hummingbirds/ms-paddleboat.jpg) \n\nThen one day, in her place we saw two dopey beaks poking out from a tiny mass of pinfeathers and sleepiness.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1aty-YjqDM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\nMs. Paddleboat, as we had named her, soon hatched two grundy lil dorkuses that we named Alfredo and Paddleboat.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat01.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat02.jpg) \n\nThey were skeptical of us from the start.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat03.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat04.jpg)\n\nWe were concerned when Ms. Paddleboat stopped coming back to the nest. It was late February and we got some pretty cold weather. The first and most prominent result of even a little googling was -- _don't_ worry and ***don't touch them***! Mother hummingbirds usually leave the nest as soon as they can, returning only to feed their little dorkuses. This is so they don't lead predators back to the nest -- which is pretty smart considering they're the size of a thimble.\n\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat05.jpg) \n\nThey got fat real quick. Alfredo got fatter faster.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat06.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat07.jpg) \n\nWe were sad when they all flew away, but we remained hopeful that we would see them again. See, we had also learned that we should leave the nest in place, as they often return to the same nest year after year. And this year that's exactly what happened! Ms. Paddleboat came back and had another birb child. Our theory was that he was planning on getting so fat there wouldn't be room for a sibling in the nest.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat08.jpg) \n\nWe named him Butter Crumpet.\n",

    "raw_markdown": "Something incredible has happened in the short two weeks since I posted about the hummingbird family that lives in our courtyard, [[The Paddleboat Family.]]\n\nSee, a tiny, seemingly unfinished nest had been sitting in one of the trees closest to the entrance to the courtyard for as long as the Paddleboats had lived there, and we assumed that it was an abandoned first try. Their nest is deeper and carefully maintained -- Ms. Paddleboat clearly shored it up when she returned to it this year.\n\nMartha and I were practicing proper social distancing as I reluctantly skipped my usual Saturday morning Taiji class. It was a highlight of stuck-at-home time: we sat by the sunny window with the two most recent New Yorkers, and some extra-good coffee (Thanks [Saebom](https://saebomyang.com/) for the vastly improved pourover technique.). To further set the scene, we were  listening to [ambient music about Tea](https://open.spotify.com/album/1hAcu6EjmoTdRd6E526HzM?si=k3kaS143S3mIhQgYbGJ0ig) that I learned about via a [Twitter friend](https://twitter.com/elisabethnicula) who has very good bird content *and* a [Jekyll blog](https://abjectsubli.me/). When I explained all this to Martha she referred to the whole situation as \"peak Ním.\"\n\nSuddenly this peaceful domestic scene was interrupted by a \"thwack\" on the window. I was instantly alarmed -- it sounded roughly hummingbird-sized!\n\nHowever, when we peered out the window we were greeted not by tiny carnage but by Martha's bff and her husband -- Kirsty and Joe! They were on a socially-distant visit!\n\n![Kirsty and Joe standing in the courtyard. Joe is standing on one foot and holding a beer and Kirsty is smiling.](/assets/notes/kirsty-joe.jpg) \n\nWe had a lovely time talking to them. Then Kirsty said \"Did you see the hummingbird's nest!\"\n\nAnd we were all like \"Yeah, duh, we've _blogged_ about them.\"\n\nBut no! She didn't mean the Paddleboats' nest -- she meant the _other_ nest. It was not abandoned at all, and atop it sat another mother hummingbird! Smaller and with green iridescent feathers -- definitely not one of the Paddleboats!\n\nKirsty got a picture with her phone:\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun01.jpg) \n\nWe couldn't believe it! (Also this picture is sideways but it's kinda better that way.)\n\nLater we went out with my telephoto lens and got a few closeups to confirm she wasn't a Paddleboat.\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun02.jpg) \n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun03.jpg) \n\nShe seems to be doing very well out there. She's on her nest almost every time we leave the house (only for socially-distant walks) and rides out the weirdly high winds we've had recently with unruffled grace.\n\nWe named her Ms. Bao Bun. Because she is a little afternoon treat.\n\nHere is a bonus picture of [[Martha]] with a Bao.\n\n![Martha eats a doughy bun in shop in Chinatown in New York City](/assets/notes/martha-bao.jpg) ",

Script run manually while experimenting, not yet integrated with the Jekyll build process or plugin-ified yet.

It feels more like Digital Monoculture Hydroponics instead of gardening, crammed into a pyramid scheme where everyone's just writing about how much more productive they are with their projects (which are mainly writing about how productive they are). Also, I swear there's a PKM-to-Jordan-Peterson pipeline. bah.\n\nThat said, by writing this I'm *currently* enjoying some new benefits of the idea of public note taking. I'm not super intent on other people reading this and caring, but the idea that they might feels like it's tightening up my thinking, like cooking a quick meal for another person instead of just your self. And my chain of messy, three-quarters-finished documents that I chucked into Garden 1.0 did help me figure some stuff out to get here. On the flip side, I can't ever see a benefit to making public the version of that I have for painting -- a sprawling, decade-old set of documents I just call \"Studio Journal.\"\n\n### A Goal:\n\nJust for me, I would love to connect everything I have that's *like* my studio journal, across the spectrum of private to public, so that I have the biggest pile of Brain Mulch I can make, and that it's easy to extract sharable Mind Things when they come up.\n\n## Puttin in mind things\n\nMany of the things that make me go \"I should put that in the memex\" are familiar entries in my brain, things I refer back to often. Decided to call these [[Mind Things]]. (I think Brain Mulch is where you can grow new Mind Things?) After enough years of changing devices or changing where I put things online the idea that there could be even semi-complete feeling, navigable *external* archive of the shelves and galleries in my brain that I consult in the studio or in conversation when I'm writing is, like, **the** main reason I'm building this. Jeez that would be nice.\n\nI think the sense that most options are built on damp sand, as it were, has prevented me from really ever using any platform to its fullest potential. I'm always impressed when someone can do that. Feels like [[Clamber]] has accomplished that. So I think I have *many* collections that are entirely in my head that *feel* like they're a real thing out in the world, but then I try to send my friends a link and the dream evaporates. (If any of you read that and were like \"yeah, me too\", *please do share!*)\n\n\n\n**An example:** For a long time I've had a notion of The Shelf -- the idea that everyone has a set of core texts that have shaped the way they see the world, or at the very least come up all the time. (The very first time I gassed myself up about making an imaginary digital space, it was entirely based on this idea. I essentially convinced myself in 2003-ish that if the world had access to a combination of Goodreads and Second Life, we would enter a new intellectual Rennaisance and I would definitely get a girlfriend who read a lot of books.)\n\n# Goalz n Hopez n Dreamz\n\na fully unexhaustive list\n\n### Art things\n\n- A record of art shows I've been to\n- Significant source material\n- Just, like, all my drawings, even if they're not part of major works\n- Major works, like, actually archivally-documented\n- Art writing\n\t- which overlaps with Let's Talk About Painting\n\t- which overlaps with Conceptual Labor\n- Works in progress archive\n- Materials & Methods archive\n\n### Nerd things\n\n- Reliable tools\n- Reliable ways\n- Compelling ideas\n- Project archive\n- The Shelf\n- Cited sources\n\n### Friend things\n- Every album book painting performance blog post piece of code sculpture project product achievement my friends have ever made.

    "raw_markdown": "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The [[Development Log]] has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend [[Ryan]], who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least [[Evan|one friend]] into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at [[Digital Gardens]] and [[cozyweb]].\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* [[astronomy-picture-of-the-day]]\n* [[public-domain-review]]\n* [[the-morning-news]]\n* and [[Martha]]'s excellent [[Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email]]\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the [[bookmarks]] bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show [[Martha|Martha]] a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader.",

I know I bookmarked it, I vaguely remember the name of the (seemingly awesome) [person that wrote it](https://friend.camp/@darius), but mostly the colors not the words of his name. Searching confronted me with the ongoing enshittification of search at the moment -- even Duck Duck Go was brimming with chum and generative clickbait-feeling stuff about boosting brand engagement. I almost gave up but the last result on the page of one search, as I was clicking away from it, had a name on it that tripped a sub-verbal set of associations that made me click through, and I found myself looking at this:\n\n![Screenshot of Bill Hunt's blog](/assets/notes/bill-hunt-blog.png)\nNot only was it the right link, it was on a... regular personal website but it looked basically like what I thought all websites should look like 20 years ago (and tbh still do), built with thing I currently prefer to make websites with.\n\nAnd, uhh, it's part of a...webring? [The Public Interest Tech Webring](https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/)?\n\nIt's moments like these that remind me that maybe my first thought when I find little patches of thriving native plants in the corners of Online monoculture shouldn't be \"how long until this disappears?\" and instead just enjoy the clicking.\n\nLike, ok I just went back to those links turns out I'm looking at the blog of one of the bigger proponents of modern [webrings](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/)!\n\nThis is like the time I started writing about why I was making a digital garden and ended up discovering the gemini protocol >> [[How This Memex Started]]\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "SHRUGGIE \nI had a 15 mile hiking day in [[canyonlands]] and thought about digital gardens until my brain melted. I dumped my thoughts about this project on [[Nik]] and he dumped them back in a [much prettier pile](https://garden.nikolas.ws/thinking-about-octothorpes/).\n\n\n[Social Web Protocol is interesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols)\n\n[DBPedia would be cool if it worked](https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org)\n\n# 5.9.2022\n\nHad a chance to look at [Dorian Taylor's](https://doriantaylor.com) library of[ RDF for Ruby](https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak) stuff. [[Nik]] is super into his stuff, and have chatted with him briefly because of this on twitter. Obvs knows a lot about all of this.\n\nOverall, my interest in digital gardens is I'm trying to stick to \"what goes in the frame\" than \"how is the frame built\". Of course, the whole octothorpe idea is very, very much a frame idea. With that in mind, and with the world benefitting from excellent frame-makers like Dorian, my hunch is that I want an in-the-middle approach like so:\n\n* Leave the website making to the things that make websites -- Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, whatever\n* It's ok for people to use their website-makers to make connections and meaning on their website in their usual way\n* Use the RDF layer to do all the mapping / relating / remaking\n\n### This means:\n\n* Any RDF and linked-data patterns should be able to read the cliff-notes version of this meaning and these connections (ie a Jekyll plugin that can convert tags / layouts to metadata)\n* I think the canonical urls for a markdown-based SSG should be raw markdown files with rich frontmatter\n* Octothorpes is a service that doesn't care how your site is made, and expects to look at markdown files like that\n* Lightweight plugins / converters maintined within the ecosystems of website-makers take care of going from Their Way of Doing Things to producing these canonical markdown files\n* How much metadata goes into a human-readable public url is decided within the website-making step\n* Octothorpes as a service a human would use does the following:\n\t* parses and associates the meaning of the metadata on canonical urls with the content (markdown) within an namespace\n\t* generates the relevant JSON-LD for that namespace\n\t* coordinates / distributes resources like the plugins that a SSG would use to hook into the Octothorpoes ecostytem\n\t* provides JS interfaces for the core features of the Octothorpes ecosystem to plunk in on sites that don't use / have access to the above plugins ^. Eg:\n\t\t* simple D3-like graph visualization of related content\n\t\t* in-line activation of \"octothorped\" terms\n\t\t* backlinks\n\t* provides an infinite and growing set of visualizations, connections, remixes, etc from it's galaxy of linked data... lalaal whatever this is the \"future is bright / open source everything\" part of the roadmap\n\t\t* *This* step is where you would generate actual webpages from pure RDF / OWL / JSON-LD whathave you. This is fine, but I don't think we should *start* there.\n\n\nSo this represents a pretty big departure from Dorian's project. His swiss-army knife is super cool and interesting, but too unwieldy to carry in your pocket everywhere\n\nI'm lookin [at this stuff](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/). Ecosystem seems healthy and well maintained.\n\n# 12.26.22\n\nWe wrote version 1 in our heads, so why not make a spec for Version 2 before we actually write it in code\n\n\n# Octothorpes\n\nOctothorpes is a lightweight protocol for creating bidirectional links and event streams between documents, regardless of whether the documents are accessible via local or networked protocols. The octothorpe ecosystem consists of:\n\n* documents\n\t* content\n\t* yaml frontmatter\n* an octothorpes parser\n* an octothorpes server\n\nWrite **documents** in plaintext or markdown, describe them with basic YAML frontmatter.\nRun an octothorpes parser to create meaningful records that describe the documents and their relationships to other records.\n\n> A Parser runs in the same environment where you access the documents. For example, if you were writing documents in markdown files on your own machine, you would use the Octothorpes CLI. If you are writing them in Wordpress on a public blog, you would use an embedded script or Wordpress plugin.\n\n**An Octothorpes parser** creates descriptive RDF records for each of your documents. These records can contain the full content of your documents, or simply a reference to a canonical source of a document's content. Parsers deal with the following entities:\n\n* Document records\n* Backlinks \n* Octothorpe Terms (also known simply as `octothorpes`)\n* User terms\n\n\n### Octothorpes server\n\n\nConnect your parser to an **octothorpe server** to relate your parsed documents to other documents and terms. A `server` reads the RDF created by parsers and provides an API for interacting with that information. Octothorpe servers respond to requests for all of the above entities and handle the following **Events**\n\n* [All ActivityPub actions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n* Sync\n* Transform\n* Feed\n\n## Entities\n\n\n### Document records\n\nParsing a document creates a descriptive record of a document that is treated as a permanent ID for that document in the Octothorpes ecosystem. \n\n> todo: document spec.\n> I think docs should only require title, alias, terms, mode (r,w,x), and content (reference or canonical)\n> but feels like more thinking is required.\n\n**Canonical document records**\n\nOptionally, the content of a document can be stored in the document record and treated as the canonical version. Separate files or URLS can be created from a canonical document record via Events, according to access rights a Server has to the environment in which those files exist. Setting a document record's mode to `read-write` requires converting it to a `CDR`. `CDRs` could also be used when moving a set of documents to a new environment, preventing accidental editing of a document, or, conversely, if your preferred method of editing a document is with a (currently nonexistent) document record editor application.\n\n\n### Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are bidirectional links between documents. Since Octothorpes uses RDF descriptions of your documents, these *can* be hyperlinks but *don't have to be.* A backlink is simply a bidirectional relationship between any two documents the Octothorpes Server can identify. An octothorpes server includes backlink relationship information with any request for a document, and can respond to direct requests for backlink nodes.\n\n> todo: resolve backlink concept with activitypub \n> maybe a good [ref here](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-activitypub)?\n\n### Octothorpe Terms\nWhereas backlinks describe a relationship between documents, Octothorpe Terms -- or simply `octothorpes` -- describe a relationship between a document and a universal term. A document that is octothorped with the term `#octothorpe` has a potential relationship to every other accessible document with the same octothorpe. \n\n**Browsing and following octothorpes**\n\nOctothorpe servers provide an API for all the terms and documents they know about. If this API is made public, it can be subscribed to or manually interacted with via ActivityStreams / ActivityPub protocols, or a `feed` request.\n\n> Example: Nik subscribes a private Octothorpes server (Server A) and subscribes to the popular public server octothorp.es. (Server B). Nim only subscribes to Server B, but  When Nik issues a request for the octothorpe `#wombats` he sees results from Servers A and B. Nim will only see results from Server B.  \n\n\n## User terms\nAn arbitrary number of terms can be associated with a document record. These can be as simple as plaintext tags or a full schema such as SKOS.\n\n> By default, Parsers should be able to read and write User terms as [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#object) and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n\n\n## Events\n\n**Sync** \n\n`Sync` is used to copy content between environments, according to the access rights of those environments.\n\nAssuming the user has appropriate rights and access in both the environment where the `Server` they `sync` to and the `Parser` that issues the request,the requested `server` will respond with the canonical content and all terms for the requested `document record`.\n\nThe `parser` which issued the `sync` request then creates an associated `document record` . Environment variables or request params can be used to set whether that `document record` uses the original as its canonical reference, creates a new file to reference, or creates a new `CDR` backlinked to the original `document record`. \n\nIf the `mode` is set to `read-write` a sync request can be sent with an `overwrite` flag, which will update the `document record` with the canonical content of a separate `document record.` \n\n**Transform**\n\n`transform` is a read-only version of `sync` that can map `document record` attributes to an arbitrary set of outputs according to schema definitions provided to the `parser` in the form of JSON / JSON-LD. This is mainly a convenience function for `parsers`, as the response from the `server` will be the same as a `sync` request, but upon success will trigger further work by the `parser` that issued the request, according to env variables, request params, and schema definitions. \n\n> Example 1: Nim writes documents in Obsidian and publishes them on a Jekyll site. Both allow backlinking via alias but use different terms to define the alias. He sets up a simple schema definition that converts the `alias` term to a `title` term. He then uses the Octothorpes CLI to `transform` documents within his working directory using the `obsidian-jekyll` schema, outputting them as markdown files in his specified Jekyll directory. \n> Example 2: Retweet the web. Nik reads an article he likes on a blog that provides public `document records` for each of its articles. Using a bookmarklet authenticated to his private `server`, he can send a `transform` request to his server which will convert the `document record` of the blog article he's reading into a document format that his own website uses, creating a `backlink` to the original `document record` in the process.\n\n**Feed**\n\nThe `feed` request will create an rss/xml/whatever feed based on request parameters or `server` defaults when sent. \n\n> Example: Nik and Nim create a shared, private `server` that they both `sync` their notes to. They don't feel like creating a website, but they want to share what they're working on. So they set a public endpoint for `feed?authors=Nik-nim&format=rss-rdf` that allows anyone to subscribe via RSS. Of course, the feed includes well-formed `document records` by default, so anyone running their own `server` locally can easily `transform` that feed into any format they want.\n\n## 10.28.23\n\nFinally reading my paper copy of Literary Machines properly after showing the memex to my sister.\n\nmisread the instructions on how to navigate the book as having multiple levels of significant underlining. as in a double or single underline have distinct meaning. maybe octothorpe notation is a double underline?",

I remembered it fondly, so when I needed a computer that could keep me reasonably connected with work but also get crushed by a train without it being a big problem, I went for a ~$200 x200. It was honestly pretty usable!\n\nThen, around 2020, I was in one of those situations with an internet service provider that involves hours of unpaid work to prove that they're gaslighting you, and I had to find a device that plugged directly into ethernet, and, lo, there was my old x200. \n\nTwo remarkable things came out of this. One, a laptop running Linux that had been powered down for six years went through about 20 minutes of software updates and was good as new. Two, I saved my studio from burning down because its aftermarket battery was growing an enormous bubble and if I hadn't dug that laptop out of storage it probably would have exploded soon thereafter.\n\nSo that's good.\n\nI ended up selling that and getting the just-better-enough x220, and did a decent amount of actual freelance work and writing on it. It's definitely a better typewriter than development machine, which is mostly what I use it for now.\n\nBut it's excellent at that! I had been running Kubuntu on it, which had some nice quality of life things, but I could _not_ get the power management under control. It regularly got hot enough to be uncomfortable on an actual human lap (mine), though the overheating vintage electronics smell the fan blew out was oddly nostalgic and pleasant.\n\nI recently scrubbed it and installed Mint, which seems to have solved the problem. I get a few hours out of it, and it stays quiet and cool.\n\nAt the moment, all it has is Obsidian, Dropbox, Firefox, and an email client on it and that's _delightful._\n\nNo notifications, *very* comfortable keyboard, dedicated keys for page up/down and browse back/forward, and a little light in the lid that shines down on the keyboard. [And the weird nub mouse thing](https://xkcd.com/243/).\n\nThis is one of those devices that has developed an intense and dedicated following -- you can buy an _x330_ now, which is not a model that was ever issued. Modders have put together an impressive suite of hacks and upgrades to make their own, new beast. As far as I ever got sucked in was installing an mSata hard drive to dual boot Windows and then modifying the BIOS to run some containerized client software -- which I am glad not to be doing anymore. [Some guy once called it the Toyota Corolla of laptops](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/why-i-use-a-thinkpad-x220-in-2021), and I agree. Wait, that's not just some guy, that's Maxime Vaillancourt, _the guy_ who wrote the Digital Garden Theme that I used as a starting point to build this memex! Clearly only geniuses use this laptop.\n\nMainly, I like it as a calm, solid feeling device that lets me do a few, focused things and doesn't interrupt me when I do.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "![An oil pastel drawing hung on a wall depicting a shortened figure in seventeenth century Dutch fashion with two red-stockinged legs sticking out from the bottom of the collar of a darkened face blending into a large, spade-shaped hat, smoking a Gouda pipe.](/assets/notes/warpaint-no-1.jpeg)\n> Warpaint no. 1, Oil pastel on paper, 2023\n> \n\nThis picture samples paintings about being at war, being a painter, and being a drunk. I plan to make more like it, and I ended up making it because I was led to it by a painting that samples paintings about death and revelry and imagined lands that I'm still working on. Immediately after finishing this picture, I started making drawings based on prepatory sketches for historical paintings and prints about apocalypse, madness, war, piousness, and dentistry.\n\nThe left foot in this painting comes from one of the strangest and most unpleasant paintings I know of,  [Soldiers Plundering a Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx#/media/File:Vrancx_Soldiers_Plundering.jpg) by [Sebastiaen Vrancx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx), who was both an unremarkable soldier and an important painter. \n\n![A 17th century painting by Sebastiaen Vrancx called soldiers plundering a farm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Vrancx_Soldiers_Plundering.jpg)\n\n\nCertainly part of the reason it feels that way is because of how long I have looked at it, but you have to do that this painting. The strangeness reveals itself over time because so much is unintentional, accumulated, or sublimated.\n\n\nThe painting, was made to have a *very* legible meaning. That you would look at it and see the villany of the soldiers as they maurauded the countryside under the lightest pretense that, at some point, they would fight in the war they were hired to fight, hopefully on the right side. Among the miliary scenes of Sebastiaen Vrancx,  this painting stands out in its scale and plot. Rather than depicting the grand sweep of an important battle between consequential generals, we have an anonymous farmhouse belonging to civilians, possibly citizens of the same empires as some of the soldestka happily slaughtering them. And everyone looks more like a cartoon than anything in Vrancx's paintings of war. It's closer to his genre work, of daily life or allegorical scenes. The tendency of classical Dutch painters to depict humans as puglike wads of bleached flesh has always fascinated and disguested me. It's like they are simultaneously criticizing humans for committing the crime of being alive and apologizing for their own complicity.\n\nThis painting is a sitcom. Look at the set framing and even the lighting. Dutch painters at this time, including Vrancx, were *very* aware of optical perspective, but applied its rules selectively. This has none of the excruciating \"accuracy\" of a still life filled with the spoils of empire. Narrative distorted the lens, placed characters in explicable rather than physical space, removed the fourth wall of the set so the audience can see everyone doing all the significant things, wearing all the signifying articles of clothing. \n\nThis painting is a cartoon. The colors, the edges, the level of detail. These are images to illustrate action. But for someone like Vrancx, a cartoon was a prepartory sketch, a diagram describing who goes where and what the edges of things are. To be more than that, to be a painting, he had to at least gesture at the incidental details of \"realism\" (a nonexistent term in the 1660s). The dull metallic sheen of the central soldier's helmet, the logs of firewood stashed away in the rafters. Perhaps the model for the man about to be struck down was a local farmer Vrancx broke bread with. Maybe he was someone he killed or watched die during his time as a soldier, maybe he was made up from Vrancx's own latent mental space of Dutch faces.\n\nThere's so much wrong and weird with this painting, but it still works. This happened, this is happening, this will happen again. How hard do we need to squint to see the official narrative, that to be a soldier means this or that, that war is necessary? How long can we hold one eye shut with that in mind until we let go and just see a bunch of young unattached men with weapons, killing and plundering people who don't have them because they were busy raising crops and children?\n\nAnd maybe it -- the attempt to communicate horror -- works better because it's so blobby and awkward? I have no idea how this appears to a normal person -- I'm at the point where the bawling toddler bawling, alone in the middle of incomprehensible chaos, has become my a  reaction meme in my own mind for various tragedies, big and small.\n\nBut I *think* the ugliness is part of what makes it work. The unfathomable unsexiness of it. The visual bluntness of the weapons, the soldier's dark robes outlined as if being explained to a child. And, as modern viewers, all of that just runs headlong into the vague, historically freighted sense of this as old valuable \"art\". It's a Dutch painting by a famous painter from the 17th Century! How much more *art* can you get than that? We have to undress it, strip the period costumes and ineffably-specific aesthetic turns, and imagine that it once was a window into a way that humans lived, perhaps a very smudged one, but a window still. From our distance the whole aesthetic of its era blurs together, but if you're looking at at the calm, well-lit rooms of Vermeer or the precise hedonism of Weenix, and you remember this painting, the toddler's wail breaks the refined mood like a siren in the distance.\n\nSpeaking of Vermeer, that's the back leg. Vermeer's (likely) actual use of actual optics gives *his* orange stocking not just a sublime luminosity, but also, you know, the shape of a human leg. And I say it's his because it's not just from his painting, but because it's his own painting of his own leg in [The Art of Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Painting). \n\n[![The Art of Painting by Jan Vermeer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/909px-Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg#/media/File:Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\")\n\n\n\nThe domestic scene that painting depicts is about as far from the plundered farmhouse as you can get, conceptually, without leaving the Dutch \"golden age\" entirely. I wonder whose stocking cost more, and who paid for the one the soldier is wearing.\n\nAnd speaking of wailing toddlers, the black hat, pipe, hair, and ghost face are from Jan Steen. Specifically his painting, [As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_Old_Sing%2C_So_Pipe_the_Young_(Jan_Steen)), and specifically the [earlier, smaller version](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/169-as-the-old-sing-so-pipe-the-young/). \n\n[![As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young, preliminary version](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/media/rixlq4ed/169_repro.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=3230&rnd=132629839593400000&quality=70)](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/169-as-the-old-sing-so-pipe-the-young/)\n\n\nThere's another toddler in this milieu, swabbing up life-shaping trauma like his playmate in the farmhouse, but having a lot more fun as he does. He's part of the \"young\" of the title -- the impressionable youth, at risk from the merriment of the adults. Steen had a grand career of painting, with deep and experienced relish, rooms full of lowlifes having an excellent time doing everything they aren't supposed to, usually putting himself right in the middle. His paintings are kind of anti-still-lives. Some nice objects that signify material wealth are getting absolutely thrashed in this very painting. Vrancx's people look messed up, but like Vrancx was still trying. When Steen exaggerates a subject's features for some lost aesthetic meaning, they look like a goddamn alien. He painted  -- and one would assume got paid for -- an aspirational [interior scene of the family Gerrit Schouten](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Steen_-_Fantasy_Interior_with_Jan_Steen_and_the_Family_of_Gerrit_Schouten_-_Google_Art_ProjectFXD.jpg), the owner of the Elephant brewery, in which his daughters are so willowy they look like praying mantises in period dress. I often wonder how he was ever sober enough to paint. \n\nGenerally, I'm averse to direct connections between the historical \"meaning\" of the paintings I'm looking at and the paintings I make because the temptation of \"getting\" it encourages you to look past the distortions. If any my paintings had a \"point,\" it would be what's wrong with them when you compare them to the paintings they look like, not what's \"right.\" There's an engagement with paint-as-paint in still lives of this era that's startlingly contemporary once you see it. Genre paintings, like the ones this picture has snipped pieces from, get distracted by plot and character. We can go from Vrancx to Vermeer to see the scope of how much *seeing* was considered important on the grand stage of life. And then, honking out an armpit fart version of  [*Het Wilhelmus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwBrR_G70RE), here comes Steen, the drunken master with his own 4 a.m. wisdom.\n\nDigging into these sitcom-cartoon-allegories full of fleshy, awkward people has built a dim, drafty theater in my mind. I'm sitting in the back of it, watching a play of manners in a language I don't understand. Sometimes the sun will break through the window so realistically I feel the warmth and am suddenly aware of exactly how ripe the pears on the table are, the number of strands of hair out of place in the lead actress's complex hairstyle. Sometimes soldiers or disease tear through and kill half the cast, and I can't tell if the blood is real. The smell of old beer certainly is.\n\nI don't understand how Steen, Vermeer, and Vrancx's scenes all existed at the same time as part of the same way of life, just like I don't understand exactly how to fit life as a painter into the world we currently have.

I was just calling it Get Set Up. That period lasted longer than I thought it would because we had to move art studios after ours got broken into multiple times in the spring, shortly after I thought I had finished my Getting Set Up. Besides all that, and partially because of it, I was in a strange and uncomfortable state with most of my projects. Like many people, my career momentum got disrupted at the start of the pandemic, but I managed to finish a few major projects in 2021/2022. But then everything got busy and chaotic and that was also most of the juice I had in me at the time, it seemed. So 2023's goal was to get all the plates spinning again, settle in to new habits and spaces and make sense of / clear out the remaining projects I had carried over from 2022/2023.\n\nMy most visible way of doing that was to put up a corkboard -- three small corkboards actually -- to track high-er level goals through out the year across various types of work. I wrote them on blue index cards and gave myself gold stars for working on them when I remembered to.\n\nThis is definitely more formal than I usual work, especially since it covered my art and music practices, but I felt like I needed it.\n\nOverall, I have to admit that it was pretty effective, in a way that didn't feel like too much extra work, even though it does feel a little... intense? dorky? not sure. Even so, I'm on board to keep it going, but I want to improve it for this year.\n\n## New flow for 2024\n\n### Vibes to improve\n\n- I got enough plates spinning that my head started to spin a little too. \n- Starting energy is different than continuing energy, and I need to make the shift. \n- Also, I'm working in multiple tracks that are the kind of thing that any one of them are deep enough for people to dedicate all of their time and energy to. Trying to do hard things in each can create some accumulating brain strain. There are healthier ways of recognizing and accepting this that I'd like to keep in front of me.\n- I'm not working at the same level across the board, so I'm also trying to balance my time and attention between what really deserves it and what just seems fun and cool at the moment.\n- I'm feeling too old to just be fuckin around on stuff. I spent most of my 30s cooking some big projects, and I'd like them to get out there.\n\n\n\n\nNew flow:\n\nput do-able goals cards on right hand corkboard at start of week\n\nassign yourself time to work on them during the week\n\ninbox only for short term goals\n\nin-flight needs a rethink, specific duration maybe\n\neverything else is a project backlog\n\nyou should be doing more concrete context switching, driven by goals or immediate tasks. ie looking at a card or a short term task, and then opening the project to see specifics, closing it when you move on to something else.",

    "raw_markdown": "![A washed out photo taken at night of a very old dark smear of something organic on the sidewalk with the photographer's two feet just visible in the bottom of the frame.](/assets/notes/the-sweet-potato-aug-6-2023.jpeg)\n> The Street Potato as of August 6, 2023\n\nMartha and I were at the [[Worker's Tap]] with [[Andrea]] talking about the micro-neighborhood of the four square blocks that encompass the Tap, her house, and our place. I mentioned The Street Potato in that way you remove detail when talking about something that has an extensive entry in your brain but you are talking to someone who might not know what you're talking about or possibly think you're somewhat crazy if you talked about it in the detail you think of it. To be clear -- I *knew* Andrea would be down with it, but didn't want to assume she had noticed it.\n\n\"Oh you mean the one up on Ankeny??\"\n\nYeah, she had noticed it.\n\nInstantly, all three of us dropped our filters and started comparing notes about the life of The Street Potato in full detail.\n\nThe Street Potato lives (died?) on a short block lined by two generic, new-construction apartment buildings. The building to the north has a half-block-long garage door and a bunch of balconies full of stuff but never people. The smaller building to the south has a row of street-level windows, most of which have a cat or evidence of a cat in them. On the sidewalk in front of the row of cat windows, some time in the early spring -- possibly even the late winter -- a large, apparently-cooked sweet potato appeared on the sidewalk. At least half of it was somewhat *in* the sidewalk -- stomped or splattered into the concrete such that The Street Potato was not about to roll away. Since then, it appears to have taken up permanent residence in that spot.\n\n\n### My theory of The Street Potato\n\n\n**I think it was thrown or otherwise ejected from a window**\n\nEvidence:\n- I believe about 75% of it flattened upon contact with the sidewalk.\n- The force to de-cohere so much of a good-sized sweet potato requires more acceleration than it would get by simply being dropped from the carrying height of an average adult.\n- It landed about ten feet from the building, farther than it would have if it simply fell.\n- This also means it was probably fully cooked.\n\n**It embodies the universe's infinite capacity for change.**\n\n- As *I* recall, it started out as recognizable sweet potato, sticking out of the sidewalk like it had clipped through it in a video game.\n- Someone stepped on it within the first few weeks of its life on the sidewalk.\n\t- This means they were probably looking at a cute cat in the window, or the abject  emptiness of the giant garage door.\n- Since being stepped on, it has been functionally two-dimensional.\n- It is at least 4 months old.\n\t- I am writing this in August. It was definitely there in April. I don't know what this means.\n\n[[Martha]] has a different theory -- the potato fell from a bag while being carried to or from some sort of dinner function, and the potato-dropper immediately slipped in the potato, grinding it into the sidewalk, perhaps with the classic slapstick slipping-on-a-banana pratfall.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "The first bookstore I worked at was [[Dawn Treader Books]], a classic, all-topics used bookstore (with a particularly strong showing in fiction, especially science fiction). I was 17, and I had also recently started volunteering at WCBN, the community radio station. \n\nThis was the late 90s, and while I had done some internetting, it was still a remarkable thing to be surrounded by stacks of media. We were still more than a decade from being always within reach of a device with the ability to drown us in content. So these huge collections of books and records and CDs were magical in a way that's kind of hard to remember. Also, I was 17 and basically an idiot, so there was lots to discover.\n\nSomething kept happening at the bookstore or the radio station that made them seem extra magical. I'd somehow stumble across a book I had just read about in the last book I was reading, or an album that turned out to be the first project by members of the last band I really got into. Things like that.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that, while I wasn't looking for these, I was very actively rejecting other books and records literally by the _thousands_. Simply by scanning the fiction section, being paid minimum wage to shelve new arrivals, browsing the records at the station, I was _not_ picking up thousands of titles every week that didn't grab my attention. And then I was picking up dozens or maybe hundreds of other titles that didn't hold it. So this created this tremendous negative pressure that caused the important things to bubble to the top. \n\nMy career in used books ended when I went to art school seven years later, but I was into this idea enough that I consciously employed it in note taking and research for my dissertation. Or half-consciously, I guess -- you can't really do it on purpose.\n\nCan't say I've had a name for it this whole time, but it's an idea that feels solid to me. So if I'm gonna write it down let's call the phenomenon a slow-motion-bullseye. \n\nI think it's a nice motivation to stay curious -- keep up the curiosity and who knows how many perfect things to read or listen to or see are slowly approaching the bullseye of your attention from all angles!",

The remembering is in the collecting of them. These seem to be pretty well-served by existing tools, analog or digital, and more in line with traditional means of archiving.\n\n#### Real Things\n\nReal Things don't quite exist without the rememberer's touch, without some interpretation. Possibly they require a production step -- they must be gone out and got, encountered before they can be collected.\n\n#### Ghost Things\n\nGhost Things are both the most real and unreal of things. I think they're a bit like the back of your head -- you need a mirror to see them and they never look quite right in the reflection, but without them your brain would fall out.\n\nI don't feel that confident in any other description of them yet, so I'm gonna keep trying to use this as a mirror and see if that gets us anywhere.",

I think this was before we lived together, and _one_ of us was harshly shaming the _other_ after discovering a bag of dinner rolls in his kitchen that he had purchased for his own consumption.\n\nThe accused acknowledged the excess of this, but explained that, in a way, it's healthier. Because, though it was, objectively, a large quantity of refined carbs for one person to eat, it was fewer *bread times.*\n\nThe irony of this appeal is that it actually goes against the fully mature concept of *a time*. This was later acknowledged by the accused when he purchased a loaf of bread, which would provide more bread *times* over a smaller *quantity* of bread.\n\nSometimes you are hungry, and you need a certain amount of food. Sometimes you are in college, and you require a certain quantity of beer. But this is different than the desire for a *time.* The rise of high-quality non-alcoholic beverages is, I believe, and indicator of this. Sometimes -- often even -- you want a _beer time_ much more than you want a beer. Sometimes you want a snack _time_ more than you want a snack. Sometimes you want four times, but you are not hungry.

    "raw_markdown": "![Two red paintings](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-060323-5.jpeg)\n\nAmy is a friend of me and [[Martha]], and a treasure of Portland's painting scene. Martha's been working at Nationale since we moved back, so we were both really stoked when Amy had a solo show there. Martha even had the pleasure of writing her exhibition statement.\n\nThe exhibition was a real knockout, especially if you've been following Amy's work for a while. Some of the pieces really felt like they'd been slowly growing for a long time, like the thickets of abundance they depicted. It felt a little like coming back to a familiar patch of forest or a trail after a couple seasons of growth. It's the place you remember, but you keep noticing evidence of the unseen force that animates it.\n\n[Here's the official documentation from Nationale](https://www.nationale.us/amy-bay-they-always-have-and-still-do-2023)\n\nAmy also gave a wonderful talk towards the end of the run of the show. She has a way of talking about her practice and the work of painting in general that is really refreshing and comfortable. It feels like she has done the work, loves the work, and has a healthy respect for the difficulty of it. And she's got the same sort of calm clarity of observation in how she talks about painting that she has in her visual depictions. So it was a good talk overall, but it was extra satisfying to hear her confirm and expand on some of the vibes I picked up. She and May (owner of Nationale) joked about the arc of changes for certain paintings between studio visits, and ended up pointing out some specific formal qualities that were new in this show.\n\n![Amy Speaking at the show](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-070623.jpeg)\nThat was something really satisfying that reminds me what's valuable about close looking or listening to artists talk about their work or good criticism or even just doing a little more research than swiping through images on Instagram. Like, that new-growth feeling I had was very present but hard to describe -- remarkable but ineffable. And I suppose I could have sat down with documentation of Amy's previous work and done some degree of comparative cataloguing and come up with some formal qualities that describe the differences. But that's not how we usually engage with paintings, and even when people have paid me to do that in writing it can take an unwieldy amount of time to get anywhere with it.\n\nBut when Amy was like \"yeah this might be the first painting of mine with a horizon line\" or pointed out that there's a semi-intentional diptych in the show, or talked at length about the mysterious insistence of the dark flower in the center of one of the most striking pieces -- those are some of those really rewarding moments of taking art seriously. I don't need everything noticeable to be explainable, but when you hear someone articulate the thing you noticed, that you keep thinking about but not in words, it's like this bridge between parts of your brain that I feel like we're generally discouraged from connecting. \n\n::::\n\nI thought I was going to write about the surfaces of these paintings more, but maybe I'll do that another time. (Which makes me think of the thesis of [[Patterns of Intention]].) Amy does really cool stuff with cold wax medium, scumbling, and very thin washes of color that makes these rich surfaces that feel organic while remaining very much just paint. \n\n\n\ncheck out the gallery here: [[They Always Have and Still Do]]",

    "raw_markdown": "**About this year's design**\n\nI (and I suspect many of you) have a small drawer full of rocks that I picked up because they [caught my eye](https://www.theonion.com/rock-looked-way-cooler-wet-1846863122) when I was somewhere I really enjoyed being -- a hike, or a seashore, or a special time and place. Each one at the moment seemed so remarkable and sharply in focus that I knew I would always remember the moment I got it whenever I picked it up again. Why blemish the experience with taking out my phone to get picture of it in its environment?\n\nSo, yeah, of course I don't remember where most of these rocks are from. But I love them! I remember many places they *could* be from, and trying to remember is pretty fun. \n\nI have added them to the paper cut so *you too* can imagine where this cool rock came from, remembering times you too might have seen a cool rock.\n\nSome rocks I *can* account for, though. The rocks in the corner are smoky quartz, given to us by a friend's mom (who also makes [tinctures](https://www.tinctureoftimellc.com/) after our studio got broken into multiple times last year. She said we should put one in each corner of our new studio for protection. Not sure if it's working, but [no break-ins so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSVqLHghLpw).\n\nOtherwise, I've gone a little more traditional than usual with this cut. It's based on the \"woodland\" style wycinanki. While researching it, I learned that one of the original ways wycinanki were displayed were to paste them up all over your cottage. \n\nThe two trees in the design are based off two amazing trees that, until recently, lived in our neighborhood. The snowstorm we just had in Portland had some high winds, and we lost a bunch of trees. One was an enormous tree that towered over Belmont Street, and another was a gorgeous willow in the Lone Fir Cemetery.\n\nThe two cats at the bottom are our two cats, [Frankenstein and Elvira](https://www.instagram.com/frankensteinandelvira/). Are they playing or fighting? Yes.\n\nAs ever, I hope to be better at correspondence this year. To that end I started a newsletter, [Big Table](https://buttondown.email/nim/archive/). If you're getting this, I have probably forcibly signed you up for it, but it goes to spam a lot so perhaps this is all news to you.\n\nHere's hoping this finds you well and that your year will, in fact, rock.\n\nhearts for eyes emoji,\n\nn",
