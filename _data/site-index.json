      "Walking up to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s recent art show at <a class='internal-link' href='/mother-foucault-s/'>Mother Foucault's</a>, I saw [*Patterns of Intention*](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300037630/patterns-of-intention/) in the window.

      "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n",
      "![Two red paintings](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-060323-5.jpeg)\n\nAmy is a friend of me and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, and a treasure of Portland's painting scene. Martha's been working at Nationale since we moved back, so we were both really stoked when Amy had a solo show there. Martha even had the pleasure of writing her exhibition statement.\n\nThe exhibition was a real knockout, especially if you've been following Amy's work for a while. Some of the pieces really felt like they'd been slowly growing for a long time, like the thickets of abundance they depicted. It felt a little like coming back to a familiar patch of forest or a trail after a couple seasons of growth. It's the place you remember, but you keep noticing evidence of the unseen force that animates it.\n\n[Here's the official documentation from Nationale](https://www.nationale.us/amy-bay-they-always-have-and-still-do-2023)\n\nAmy also gave a wonderful talk towards the end of the run of the show. She has a way of talking about her practice and the work of painting in general that is really refreshing and comfortable. It feels like she has done the work, loves the work, and has a healthy respect for the difficulty of it. And she's got the same sort of calm clarity of observation in how she talks about painting that she has in her visual depictions. So it was a good talk overall, but it was extra satisfying to hear her confirm and expand on some of the vibes I picked up. She and May (owner of Nationale) joked about the arc of changes for certain paintings between studio visits, and ended up pointing out some specific formal qualities that were new in this show.\n\n![Amy Speaking at the show](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-070623.jpeg)\nThat was something really satisfying that reminds me what's valuable about close looking or listening to artists talk about their work or good criticism or even just doing a little more research than swiping through images on Instagram. Like, that new-growth feeling I had was very present but hard to describe -- remarkable but ineffable. And I suppose I could have sat down with documentation of Amy's previous work and done some degree of comparative cataloguing and come up with some formal qualities that describe the differences. But that's not how we usually engage with paintings, and even when people have paid me to do that in writing it can take an unwieldy amount of time to get anywhere with it.\n\nBut when Amy was like \"yeah this might be the first painting of mine with a horizon line\" or pointed out that there's a semi-intentional diptych in the show, or talked at length about the mysterious insistence of the dark flower in the center of one of the most striking pieces -- those are some of those really rewarding moments of taking art seriously. I don't need everything noticeable to be explainable, but when you hear someone articulate the thing you noticed, that you keep thinking about but not in words, it's like this bridge between parts of your brain that I feel like we're generally discouraged from connecting. \n\n::::\n\nI thought I was going to write about the surfaces of these paintings more, but maybe I'll do that another time. (Which makes me think of the thesis of <a class='internal-link' href='/patterns-of-intention/'>Patterns of Intention</a>.) Amy does really cool stuff with cold wax medium, scumbling, and very thin washes of color that makes these rich surfaces that feel organic while remaining very much just paint. \n\n\n\ncheck out the gallery here: <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/they-always-have-and-still-do/'>They Always Have and Still Do</a>"

And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n"

An individual’s life consisted of certain classified things: “real things” which were unfrequent and priceless, simply “things” which formed the routine stuff of life; and “ghost things,” also called “fogs,” such as fever, toothache, dreadful disappointments, and death. Three or more things occurring at the same time formed a “tower,” or, if they came in immediate succession, they made a “bridge.” “Real towers” and “real bridges” were the joys of life, and when the towers came in a series, one experienced supreme rapture; it almost never happened, though. In some circumstances, in a certain light, a neutral “thing” might look or even actually become “real” or else, conversely, it might coagulate into a fetid “fog.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

The remembering is in the collecting of them. These seem to be pretty well-served by existing tools, analog or digital, and more in line with traditional means of archiving.\n\n#### Real Things\n\nReal Things don't quite exist without the rememberer's touch, without some interpretation. Possibly they require a production step -- they must be gone out and got, encountered before they can be collected.\n\n#### Ghost Things\n\nGhost Things are both the most real and unreal of things.

      "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n"

Groups are a runtime effect.You cannot specify in advance what any given group will do, and so you can’t instantiate in software everything you expect to have happen. Now, there’s a large body of literature saying, “We built this soft-ware, a group came and used it, and they began to exhibit behaviors that surprised us enormously, so we’ve gone and documented these behaviors.” Over and over and over again this pattern comes up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

      "![Screenshot from the webcomic Achewood showing Ray Smuckles, the cat, sending chat messages to his best friend Roast Beef using a custom chat app that Beef made called Ray_and_Beef_Chat 8.0](/assets/texts/ray-beef-chat.png)\n\nThis is my ideal DM experience. The `8.0` indicates so much *care.* (To be clear, entirely on Beef's part.)\n\n_(This is part two of <a class='internal-link' href='/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/'>We Really Like Personal Sites But the Internet Has Been Turning into Poisonous Garbage At An Alarming Rate</a>)_\n\nI have a rule on my phone, and it has always been this way. Only humans are allowed to make my phone ask for my attention. And only recently have I appreciated what horrors it has saved me from. The notifications I currently get are:\n\n- texts from humans (incl signal and whatsapp)\n- direct mentions or messages on slack or mastodon\n- ...uhh that's it\n\nI don't even get notifications from the private discord I host for my friends (I would but it seems broken and who am I to argue with it). I certainly don't get notifications from Instagram, even for DMs, for the same reason that if a friend wants to talk to me in a crowded bus station I will suggest we go outside first.\n\n## Notifications should come from People Not Apps\n\nPeople, not apps, deserve my spontaneous attention. I'm not going to explain why. I don't think I'm smart or special for doing it this way. I'm still waiting for someone to explain why it should be any other way. When I see a push notification for ᴄʜɪᴘᴏᴛʟᴇ x ᴊᴏᴊᴏ ꜱɪᴡᴀ ɪꜱ ᴄᴜʀʀᴇɴᴛʟʏ ʟɪᴠᴇ ᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀʟʟɢʀᴇᴇɴꜱ ᴇxᴘᴇʀɪᴇɴᴄᴇ appear on a friend's phone, I feel the same concern and desire to throw away their personal property that I would as if I found a tupperware labeled \"Fentanyl for later\" in their fridge. This comes from the same feral sense that makes us occasionally want to throw our phones in a lake.\n\nI'm not alone in trying to unpack what that feral sense needs. I think it's one of our few guideposts in the era of talking to the internet. Unlike my list of how the internet used to be, we don't really have a primordial era of notifications. We had email, chat rooms, text, and then smartphones and Facebook threw the sluice gates open. It's harder to parse which expectations for the social internet are sustainable and which are toxic, because they developed -- and are still developing -- largely in tandem with the ideas of the huge corporations that shoved social media into existence.\n\n\n### But also we want this\n\nThe biggest thing missing from my \"back in my day\" list was socializing. As in *socializing on* the internet, as opposed to \"because I got invited to something through the internet.\" One could argue that this was better, but one would be arguing with a rising sea. And of course the line between our online and irl social lives has been blurred beyond notice for years now. And we all have had real, treasured, human experiences that were only possible because of the internet. My late friend Corby had chronic health issues which often limited his mobility, and when he was stuck inside one of the things he'd do was post long, branching stories to a forum his friends ran. I treasure those stories now that he's gone. (There was also a webcomic.)\n\nI try to remember that the social internet is still relatively new, weird, and unfinished, because that means *we're still deciding what it can be.* And regular people have as much of a share in that \"we\" as the massive corporations do. Hashtags on Twitter happened because users started using them before official adoption. [A03 basically made tags a turing complete language](https://www.mmmx.cloud/fan-is-a-tool-using-animal/).\n\nI admire when people can do that, just say \"[idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.](https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers)\"  [It's a foundational principle of the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/a-group-is-its-own-worst-enemy/). Without realizing it, I think I left that audacity in the land of websites, and fell in line with the social internet more than I wanted to.\n\nThere were two moments I can actually identify that woke me up to the idea that *I could have expectations* of social media and take some agency in how I use it. It reminded me that what we think of as social media is really just some ways of doing things on top of the basic fact that people can talk to each other through the internet. Basically that *it doesn't have to be this way.*\n\n### Awakening #1: Darius Kazemi's Run Your Own Social\n\nReading just the *headlines* of [this excellent guide](https://runyourown.social/) is enough to crack the shackles of Big Social from your mind. There is a direct line between me reading  *[You get to make the social rules and policies](https://runyourown.social/#you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies)* if you make your own social network and me starting up a private forum called Paddleboat for my friends at the beginning of the pandemic that became a loved and comfortable online space for some of us during those scary early days. When interest flagged below the $30-a-month-feels-ok-to-me level, we moved to Discord instead, called it Rollerblade, and now it's still going strong. It even got a shoutout in my friend [Ezra's newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies/archive/long-covid-studies-the-origin-story/).\n### Awakening #2: Ezra's favorite social network\n\nSpeaking of Ezra, five or six years ago, I was probably griping about Facebook, and Ezra said, offhand, that his favorite social network is just group texts. And that he had multiple ongoing ones with different themes. Shortly after that we started one with our friend Clare named, for obscure reasons, `Chubswombat` which uses the Tubthumper album art as an avatar, for obvious reasons. It is still going.\n\nI have always admired how remarkably good Ezra is at connecting with people online and with talking to people about his ideas in general. (He's recently been using his powers to push forward Long Covid action, despite Long Covid's efforts to stop him, and you should [subscribe to his newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies#subscribe-form) and call your local representatives.)\n\nThe wisdom of this statement helped get and keep me off Facebook at the start of lockdown and reminded me how effortless and fun it can be to \"post\" with friends. We paid for our phones and service, why do we need to see ads to talk to each other? Since then I have enjoyed group threads including but not limited to:\n\n- A yearslong round of [The RV Game](https://www.martenstuffer.com/anal-rvs)\n- The Castle of Friendship\n- All logistics for the DnD group I run, grouptext having defeated every other platform we attempted to use\n- Weird chips\n- Catsitting in my building\n- My niece's \"youtube channel\" which is just her making videos on her mom's phone and then her mom sending it to me and my wife and us \"liking\" and \"subscribing\"\n- Photos of the Kaiser Permanente building in Portland\n- Emoji notifications when one of two of my friends is peeing. (This started because one walked in on the other in the bathroom like a decade ago. Not sure how I got added.)\n- Videos a friend has been making with a wig she drags on a string like a pet\n\nMy favorite part of getting a smartphone was sending and getting pictures of works in progress with fellow painters. My favorite part of Instagram is seeing other painters' paintings and three group DMs I am in. _Maybe we don't actually need the rest of Instagram._ (**Maybe** the non-linkable, non-zoomable, non-text-copy-able _automatically disappearing_ portion of a closed surveillence advertising platform is *not* the ideal place to share logistical information about local grassroots cultural events but *what do I know.*)\n\n\n## What this means to me\n\nI think the values laid out in Run Your Own Social get pretty far towards a set of values for a social internet. And I think we're still pretty far from a world where it's easy to find platforms that embody them. I also think...we won't because... maybe... not? platforms? at all?\n\nMaybe the meta-value for whatever comes next is just this:\n\n## Social Networks Should Meet You Where You Already Are\n\nIf you try to make a new social network, the biggest obstacle is getting people to stop using the one where all their friends already are and use yours. So it can feel like TikTok or Instagram or Facebook are where people already are. This is true in a way. But the number of other people we can really connect with and keep track of is too small for big platforms to make money off our activity. So they have to train individuals to act like businesses or famous people. They teach us to talk like we're broadcasting while being told we're among friends. When we flee that pressure, we make themed chats, local groups, events, memes. That's where we actually are as *people* instead of *users*. \n\nThe platforms are the biggest, stinkiest bus stations imaginable. The scale of activity is thrilling, the access they provide has become important infrastructure, but the people that try to talk to the whole bus station at once are either hucksters, potentially violent, shills, or otherwise sketchy. We *avoid* those conversations and find small spaces where we can talk to each other. We are sharing a booth with some friends, or sitting on a bench with a few strangers, waiting to go to the same place. We want to talk to people, not platforms.\n\n\n## Our part in this\n\nI've never really articulated it to this level of detail, but some feral sense beneath the discomfort of having to go to the world's biggest stinkiest bus station just to share a booth with some friends and talk about paintings is how I got thinking about free-floating hashtags on a 15 mile day in Canyonlands (and possibly to distract from our inadequate water supply). My initial spec was very document-based, because documents were where I already was. (If you ever work with nonprofits or the government, you'll know that's where a lot of people still are.) I want a little Nim_and_Nik_Chat 8.0 magically integrated with this markdown document, and I want it to be easy for other people to have their version of that too. I love that as soon as I put this online and octothorpe it, Nik will get an email. I love that it will automatically show up in my list of essays on [a blog post I made on another website.](https://ideastore.dev/blog/why-tho/). I love that I don't know where else it will show up in the future.\n\nBut in the end it doesn't matter where you start -- the idea is that, wherever you already are, if you can't connect to your friends *and have a good conversation*, we'd like to make something that makes that possible. This is crucially different than \"wherever you are, you should be able to shout at the whole bus station at once.\" I also hope it will be crucially different than \"we just made another bus station with fewer people and weird rules.\" That will depend on how good Octothorpes is at letting people say \"idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.\""

      "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The <a class='internal-link' href='/development-log/'>Development Log</a> has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend <a class='internal-link' href='/ryan/'>Ryan</a>, who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least <a class='internal-link' href='/evan/'>one friend</a> into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Digital Gardens  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and <a class='internal-link' href='/tag/cozyweb/'>cozyweb</a>.\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  astronomy-picture-of-the-day  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  public-domain-review  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  the-morning-news  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s excellent <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  bookmarks  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader."

      "Ok, so maybe the old, small web has some juice left in it.\n\nHere I am writing a short essay about why I'm building a memex in 2023, and the enshittification of search engines made it very hard to find the [popular essay](https://runyourown.social/) that inspired me to start a private social network in the pandemic. I know I bookmarked it, I vaguely remember the name of the (seemingly awesome) [person that wrote it](https://friend.camp/@darius), but mostly the colors not the words of his name. Searching confronted me with the ongoing enshittification of search at the moment -- even Duck Duck Go was brimming with chum and generative clickbait-feeling stuff about boosting brand engagement. I almost gave up but the last result on the page of one search, as I was clicking away from it, had a name on it that tripped a sub-verbal set of associations that made me click through, and I found myself looking at this:\n\n![Screenshot of Bill Hunt's blog](/assets/notes/bill-hunt-blog.png)\nNot only was it the right link, it was on a... regular personal website but it looked basically like what I thought all websites should look like 20 years ago (and tbh still do), built with thing I currently prefer to make websites with.\n\nAnd, uhh, it's part of a...webring? [The Public Interest Tech Webring](https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/)?\n\nIt's moments like these that remind me that maybe my first thought when I find little patches of thriving native plants in the corners of Online monoculture shouldn't be \"how long until this disappears?\" and instead just enjoy the clicking.\n\nLike, ok I just went back to those links turns out I'm looking at the blog of one of the bigger proponents of modern [webrings](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/)!\n\nThis is like the time I started writing about why I was making a digital garden and ended up discovering the gemini protocol >> <a class='internal-link' href='/how-this-memex-started/'>How This Memex Started</a>\n\n",
      "Ryan is as nice as he is tall, which is \"very!\"\n\nHe works with <a class='internal-link' href='/nik/'>Nik Wise</a> and this garden sprouted from a <a class='internal-link' href='/how-this-memex-started/'>seed that fell from his tweet.</a>\n",
      "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n"

      "Buckmanite, or Buckman Slate, is a metamorphic substance endemic to many urban environments, but first identified in the Buckman neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It is a composite material formed when plastic municipal containers undergo rapid exothermic reactions, deforming to bond with the surrounding environment. These reactions are most often triggered by human intervention, both accidental and intentional, but theoretically could be triggered by natural phenomena such as lightning or incidental lensing of sunlight through nearby mirrors or windows during a heatwave. \n\n![A Typical depost of Buckmanite](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Deposit Typical.jpeg)\n\nBuckmanite usually ranges from dark to light blue in appearance, while green, brown, and even yellow varieties have been identified. When fully formed, Buckmanite is usually found in wide, pool-like deposits characterized by an irregular, layered surface, mechanically bonded to the ground substrate. Buckmanite is unusual in its ability to form novel cement-like structures and fuse with existing cement or composite materials.\n\n### Buckmanite as cement matrix\n\nMany factors influence the composition of Buckmanite. The time of year, time of day, microclimate, and even the side of the street on which Buckmanite forms can dictate the internal structure of the material. Substances within and without the original form of the container will become suspended in the transformed material. These include leaves, inorganic refuse, and grains of sidewalk or asphalt up to 1cm across. \n\n### Buckmanite as cement ingredient\n\nSignificant deposits can be easily removed with common hand tools, but thinner layers may integrate so fully into their environment as to become a permanent feature. Pre-transformation, the polymer components of Buckmanite are fully mobile in relation to the cement surfaces of its typical environment. The energetic process of its formation bonds the material to its hyperlocal environment. In this way the material represents a transition from container to surface.\n\n![Buckmanite in the process of merging with its envirionment](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Typical Substrate Partial Formation Close View.jpeg)\n\n\nEven partial formation of Buckmanite is enough to cause an ontological metamorphosis of its source materials. Here, a container has lost its internality and has become refuse in need of containing.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite Disposal.jpeg)\n\n### Exotic components\n\nBuckmanite is defined by a process and location as much as it is by pure material composition. Many different possible structures and appearances of Buckmanite have been theorized. Pictured here is a dramatic example of the incomplete formation of Buckmanite from an atypical source. Note that the original structure was not able to sustain an exothermic reaction long enough to fully transform.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite%20-%20Atypical%20Substrate%20%20Partial%20Formation.jpeg)\n\n### Environmental Indicator\n\nWhile the physical components of Buckmanite are common, its formation most typically occurs within specific sociological conditions. These conditions can be grouped as **Ignition Conditions** and **Formation Conditions.**\n\n## Ignition conditions\n\nA primary condition seems to be the intersection of consistent on-street activity within residential or mixed-use neighborhoods. The housed population and local businesses are responsible for the continued presence of refuse containers, and enough range of on-street activity will provide an ongoing presence of unsanctioned interactions (ie any interaction not within the [use permitted by the city](https://www.portland.gov/bps/garbage-recycling/garbage-recycling-and-compost-rules-and-regulations) or private owners of the containers). The combination, will, in select circumstances, provide the conditions required to ignite the material. \n\nFolk theories tend to assign responsibility to unhoused or otherwise indigent actors, but ample field observations contradict this theory. The crucial criteria here is *activity on the street.* Whether that activity comes from a housed or unhoused population is not relevant. Whether or not formation conditions exist, ignition conditions are frequently met by affluent residents of or visitors to neighborhood with a high density of alcohol-serving establishments or proximity to major sporting arenas. The common misconception that ignition conditions are necessarily intentional has been repeatedly disproven. In fact, accidental ignition is perhaps even more common than intentional.\n\n## Formation conditions\n\nPerhaps as part of some form of ecological homeostasis, the conditions required for Buckmanite formation only exist in regions with inorganic substrates and little vegetation. Were refuse containers to be commonly found in rural or forested areas, ignition would likely cause a wildfire. Buckmanite exists in a space between controlled and wild environments. A refuse container completely destroyed by a wildfire is not recognizable as Buckmanite, just as a simple garbage fire that fails to bond with its neighborhood also fails to qualify as this unique substance.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nMuch like other modern minerals such as [Fordite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordite), Buckmanite is a material formed a specific time and place, reflecting the cultural conditions of its site. \n\n## Gallery\n\nPlease enjoy this gallery of <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/buckmanite/'>Buckmanite Samples</a>\n\n\n"

I mentioned The Street Potato in that way you remove detail when talking about something that has an extensive entry in your brain but you are talking to someone who might not know what you're talking about or possibly think you're somewhat crazy if you talked about it in the detail you think of it. To be clear -- I *knew* Andrea would be down with it, but didn't want to assume she had noticed it.\n\n\"Oh you mean the one up on Ankeny??\"\n\nYeah, she had noticed it.\n\nInstantly, all three of us dropped our filters and started comparing notes about the life of The Street Potato in full detail.\n\nThe Street Potato lives (died?) on a short block lined by two generic, new-construction apartment buildings. The building to the north has a half-block-long garage door and a bunch of balconies full of stuff but never people. The smaller building to the south has a row of street-level windows, most of which have a cat or evidence of a cat in them. On the sidewalk in front of the row of cat windows, some time in the early spring -- possibly even the late winter -- a large, apparently-cooked sweet potato appeared on the sidewalk. At least half of it was somewhat *in* the sidewalk -- stomped or splattered into the concrete such that The Street Potato was not about to roll away. Since then, it appears to have taken up permanent residence in that spot.\n\n\n### My theory of The Street Potato\n\n\n**I think it was thrown or otherwise ejected from a window**\n\nEvidence:\n- I believe about 75% of it flattened upon contact with the sidewalk.\n- The force to de-cohere so much of a good-sized sweet potato requires more acceleration than it would get by simply being dropped from the carrying height of an average adult.\n- It landed about ten feet from the building, farther than it would have if it simply fell.\n- This also means it was probably fully cooked.\n\n**It embodies the universe's infinite capacity for change.**\n\n- As *I* recall, it started out as recognizable sweet potato, sticking out of the sidewalk like it had clipped through it in a video game.\n- Someone stepped on it within the first few weeks of its life on the sidewalk.\n\t- This means they were probably looking at a cute cat in the window, or the abject  emptiness of the giant garage door.\n- Since being stepped on, it has been functionally two-dimensional.\n- It is at least 4 months old.\n\t- I am writing this in August. It was definitely there in April. I don't know what this means.\n\n<a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> has a different theory -- the potato fell from a bag while being carried to or from some sort of dinner function, and the potato-dropper immediately slipped in the potato, grinding it into the sidewalk, perhaps with the classic slapstick slipping-on-a-banana pratfall.\n\n",

I think it was accidentally a steam beer, which are usually ales, but this was a lager somehow. It brewed at a very high temperature in her gazebo and turned out great.\n\nIt's not really called Turd Lake, but she sent me a picture of the logo, which is a grain of rice, and I said it looked like a lake seen from above and she was like \"phew, Chris said it looked like a turd.\"\n\nI should stress the beer is really good, and it fermented in her gazebo. It doesn't deserve to be called Turd Lake.\n\n![a text message saying that our friend chris only worried a small part of the logo would make people think it was a turd](/assets/notes/tlb-correction.png)"

Share it with friends in good natured competition. Partake in each other's sandwiches, and taste the unique visions of your friends.\n\n## The Rules\n\n- The sandwich must be unique to you. This could be your own version of an existing sandwich, or something completely original.\n- Keep your sandwich secret until the event.\n- Make three identical versions of the same sandwich.\n\t- One for reference\n\t- One for the judges\n\t- One to share with your fellow sandwich artists.\n- Present your sandwich with a small side and beverage.\n- What defines and constitutes a sandwich is up to you, as long as you can justify it.\n- You are not required to make every component of the sandwich. Much of the art of sandwiches is curation, so what you choose to put in is as important as what you make yourself.\n- *However*, you must be the only sandwich artist. No teams.\n\n## The Contest\n\nA panel of three judges will sample and score your sandwich according to three categoreis. All judgement is relative to each sandwich's vision, not based on an ideal of what a sandwich should be:\n\n1. Taste\n2. Presentation -- This includes structure, plating, and preparation. \n3. Concept -- This doesn't imply *high concept.* Simply -- what have you tried to do, and how well did you do it? It could be simply \"this is what a sloppy joe means to me\" or as complex as \"this sandwich expresses the life and accomplishments of Klaus Nomi\"\n\n## Logistics\n\n**When:** Last week of September\n\n**Where:** TBD -- please report your prep needs to Ním, and he will figure out the best venue to suit everyone. Possibly it will be his house, but who knows.\n\n**Why:** Do you even need to ask.\n\n### Influences\n\nTo be clear, I don't think you should make a sandwich that tastes *like your personality*, but, after seeing <a class='internal-link' href='/caitlyn/'>Caitlyn</a>'s [potato tattoo](https://wayside.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin%27s_Big_Decision), I think this might be subconsciously influenced by [Sideways Stories From Wayside School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideways_Stories_from_Wayside_School). Specifically the chapter *Maurecia*, in which ice cream flavors are made that so perfectly reflect the personalities of each student that no one can taste their own flavor. According to [shmoop.com's study guide](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/sideways-stories-from-wayside-school/maurecia-flavored-ice-cream-symbol.html) for this chapter:\n\n> The strangeness of person-flavored ice cream aside, this means that the ice cream is a symbol for getting to know people. You never know who you'll end up liking if you just give them a chance… or a lick, as the case may be. Plus each flavor is different, which also reminds us that the kids at Wayside—just like the rest of us—are each unique and wonderful in their own way.\n\nI do 100% endorse the idea that your sandwiches should remind us that we are each unique and wonderful in our own way.\n\n"

      "# Brain Mulch and Mind Things\n\nIf only to be less confusing when I ramble about digital gardens and memexes and so on to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, I've been trying to figure out a clear difference between the two ideas, or at least how I'm approaching them.\n\nDigital Gardening seems more geared towards <a class='internal-link' href='/brain-mulch/'>Brain Mulch</a> -- notes about stuff, bookmarks or saved thoughts or links, encouraged to build up, ferment, and grow into more thinglike-things, but remain content with the mulching process.\n\n### On \"knowledge management\"\n\n> One thing I learned trying that for a year is that the specter of PKM or \"personal knowledge management\" that looms over all these ideas makes me want to barf. The public-note-taking part of it feels performative and is a terrible fit for my existing, useful research processes. It feels more like Digital Monoculture Hydroponics instead of gardening, crammed into a pyramid scheme where everyone's just writing about how much more productive they are with their projects (which are mainly writing about how productive they are). Also, I swear there's a PKM-to-Jordan-Peterson pipeline. bah.\n\nThat said, by writing this I'm *currently* enjoying some new benefits of the idea of public note taking. I'm not super intent on other people reading this and caring, but the idea that they might feels like it's tightening up my thinking, like cooking a quick meal for another person instead of just your self. And my chain of messy, three-quarters-finished documents that I chucked into Garden 1.0 did help me figure some stuff out to get here. On the flip side, I can't ever see a benefit to making public the version of that I have for painting -- a sprawling, decade-old set of documents I just call \"Studio Journal.\"\n\n### A Goal:\n\nJust for me, I would love to connect everything I have that's *like* my studio journal, across the spectrum of private to public, so that I have the biggest pile of Brain Mulch I can make, and that it's easy to extract sharable Mind Things when they come up.\n\n## Puttin in mind things\n\nMany of the things that make me go \"I should put that in the memex\" are familiar entries in my brain, things I refer back to often. Decided to call these <a class='internal-link' href='/mind-things/'>Mind Things</a>. (I think Brain Mulch is where you can grow new Mind Things?) After enough years of changing devices or changing where I put things online the idea that there could be even semi-complete feeling, navigable *external* archive of the shelves and galleries in my brain that I consult in the studio or in conversation when I'm writing is, like, **the** main reason I'm building this. Jeez that would be nice.\n\nI think the sense that most options are built on damp sand, as it were, has prevented me from really ever using any platform to its fullest potential. I'm always impressed when someone can do that. Feels like <a class='internal-link' href='/case/'>Case</a> has accomplished that. So I think I have *many* collections that are entirely in my head that *feel* like they're a real thing out in the world, but then I try to send my friends a link and the dream evaporates. (If any of you read that and were like \"yeah, me too\", *please do share!*)\n\n\n\n**An example:** For a long time I've had a notion of The Shelf -- the idea that everyone has a set of core texts that have shaped the way they see the world, or at the very least come up all the time. (The very first time I gassed myself up about making an imaginary digital space, it was entirely based on this idea. I essentially convinced myself in 2003-ish that if the world had access to a combination of Goodreads and Second Life, we would enter a new intellectual Rennaisance and I would definitely get a girlfriend who read a lot of books.)\n\n# Goalz n Hopez n Dreamz\n\na fully unexhaustive list\n\n### Art things\n\n- A record of art shows I've been to\n- Significant source material\n- Just, like, all my drawings, even if they're not part of major works\n- Major works, like, actually archivally-documented\n- Art writing\n\t- which overlaps with Let's Talk About Painting\n\t- which overlaps with Conceptual Labor\n- Works in progress archive\n- Materials & Methods archive\n\n### Nerd things\n\n- Reliable tools\n- Reliable ways\n- Compelling ideas\n- Project archive\n- The Shelf\n- Cited sources\n\n### Friend things\n- Every album book painting performance blog post piece of code sculpture project product achievement my friends have ever made.

      "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The <a class='internal-link' href='/development-log/'>Development Log</a> has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend <a class='internal-link' href='/ryan/'>Ryan</a>, who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least <a class='internal-link' href='/evan/'>one friend</a> into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Digital Gardens  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and <a class='internal-link' href='/tag/cozyweb/'>cozyweb</a>.\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  astronomy-picture-of-the-day  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  public-domain-review  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  the-morning-news  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s excellent <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  bookmarks  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader.",

      "Walking up to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s recent art show at <a class='internal-link' href='/mother-foucault-s/'>Mother Foucault's</a>, I saw [*Patterns of Intention*](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300037630/patterns-of-intention/) in the window. They're distressingly good at putting books I want in the window -- I think 90% of the books I've bought there have come from the window. Or maybe I'm just a lazy browser and need to literally see it from the street to pay attention.\n\nAt the moment, I'm still trying to figure out why and where from I know this book. I might have cited it before, or seen it cited, or something. Baxandall has certainly come up before. TBH I'm kind of hoping that I actually don't have a good reason and it was just one of those <a class='internal-link' href='/slow-motion-bullseyes/'>Slow Motion Bullseyes</a> \n\nI've really just started it, but it's pretty compelling so far. I'm automatically on board with one of the central ideas, that when we describe images we are mostly making statements about the description -- we can't assume that there's this special unbroken connection between the nature of the painting and the things we're saying about it. This is very conceptual-labor-y -- that we're working with our model of the image, and can refine it to get closer to the \"actual\" image, but never escape it.\n\nWas on my mind when writing about <a class='internal-link' href='/amy-bay-at-nationale/'>Amy Bay at Nationale</a>. Thought I'd write about paint, ended up writing about what I think about paintings.",
      "Something incredible has happened in the short two weeks since I posted about the hummingbird family that lives in our courtyard, <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  The Paddleboat Family.  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\nSee, a tiny, seemingly unfinished nest had been sitting in one of the trees closest to the entrance to the courtyard for as long as the Paddleboats had lived there, and we assumed that it was an abandoned first try. Their nest is deeper and carefully maintained -- Ms. Paddleboat clearly shored it up when she returned to it this year.\n\nMartha and I were practicing proper social distancing as I reluctantly skipped my usual Saturday morning Taiji class. It was a highlight of stuck-at-home time: we sat by the sunny window with the two most recent New Yorkers, and some extra-good coffee (Thanks [Saebom](https://saebomyang.com/) for the vastly improved pourover technique.). To further set the scene, we were  listening to [ambient music about Tea](https://open.spotify.com/album/1hAcu6EjmoTdRd6E526HzM?si=k3kaS143S3mIhQgYbGJ0ig) that I learned about via a [Twitter friend](https://twitter.com/elisabethnicula) who has very good bird content *and* a [Jekyll blog](https://abjectsubli.me/). When I explained all this to Martha she referred to the whole situation as \"peak Ním.\"\n\nSuddenly this peaceful domestic scene was interrupted by a \"thwack\" on the window. I was instantly alarmed -- it sounded roughly hummingbird-sized!\n\nHowever, when we peered out the window we were greeted not by tiny carnage but by Martha's bff and her husband -- Kirsty and Joe! They were on a socially-distant visit!\n\n![Kirsty and Joe standing in the courtyard. Joe is standing on one foot and holding a beer and Kirsty is smiling.](/assets/notes/kirsty-joe.jpg) \n\nWe had a lovely time talking to them. Then Kirsty said \"Did you see the hummingbird's nest!\"\n\nAnd we were all like \"Yeah, duh, we've _blogged_ about them.\"\n\nBut no! She didn't mean the Paddleboats' nest -- she meant the _other_ nest. It was not abandoned at all, and atop it sat another mother hummingbird! Smaller and with green iridescent feathers -- definitely not one of the Paddleboats!\n\nKirsty got a picture with her phone:\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun01.jpg) \n\nWe couldn't believe it! (Also this picture is sideways but it's kinda better that way.)\n\nLater we went out with my telephoto lens and got a few closeups to confirm she wasn't a Paddleboat.\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun02.jpg) \n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun03.jpg) \n\nShe seems to be doing very well out there. She's on her nest almost every time we leave the house (only for socially-distant walks) and rides out the weirdly high winds we've had recently with unruffled grace.\n\nWe named her Ms. Bao Bun. Because she is a little afternoon treat.\n\nHere is a bonus picture of <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> with a Bao.\n\n![Martha eats a doughy bun in shop in Chinatown in New York City](/assets/notes/martha-bao.jpg) ",
      "Discussing Bread Times is how <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> and I acknowledged the existence and importance of _times_. I think this was before we lived together, and _one_ of us was harshly shaming the _other_ after discovering a bag of dinner rolls in his kitchen that he had purchased for his own consumption.\n\nThe accused acknowledged the excess of this, but explained that, in a way, it's healthier. Because, though it was, objectively, a large quantity of refined carbs for one person to eat, it was fewer *bread times.*\n\nThe irony of this appeal is that it actually goes against the fully mature concept of *a time*. This was later acknowledged by the accused when he purchased a loaf of bread, which would provide more bread *times* over a smaller *quantity* of bread.\n\nSometimes you are hungry, and you need a certain amount of food. Sometimes you are in college, and you require a certain quantity of beer. But this is different than the desire for a *time.* The rise of high-quality non-alcoholic beverages is, I believe, and indicator of this. Sometimes -- often even -- you want a _beer time_ much more than you want a beer. Sometimes you want a snack _time_ more than you want a snack. Sometimes you want four times, but you are not hungry. That is ok. An awareness of _times_ as distinct from _amounts_ can liberate you from the tyranny of conventional consumption.",
      "I had a really vivid dream last night involving my late friend Corby. Since he passed away in 2018, he's shown up in my dreams a few times, but as far as I remember he was alive in those dreams. In this dream he was a ghost, and he knew it and I knew it.\n\nCorby ran his family's bookstore, <a class='internal-link' href='/dawn-treader-books/'>Dawn Treader Books</a>. It's still going strong under really great new management. I was just in there last month on my last visit to Michigan for Pete's wedding. So I think the version I was working with in my dream was pretty current.\n\nI don't know how I found myself there, but I was having a hard time finding what I was looking for. That happened the last time I was there, but I know that feeling comes from the fact that for two decades of my life, I'd see Corby when I walked in and that still feels like how it should be. I left, but then realized I had left my 90's-style cellphone there. When I walked back in, a huge group of students in white shirts was collecting on the landing of the stairs at the entrance. With dream logic, the more there were, the bigger the landing got. I asked the person working the counter what was going on and they said that they were from a class at the art college very similar to the one that <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> is teaching right now, and that in a minute their professor would get there and they'd teach their class in the store. It felt strange and new and like I didn't belong.\n\nWhile I stood there thinking, Corby just walked up, writing either a price or a duplicate card for the paperback he had in his hand. He looked like he did when he was in better health. Unlike other dreams, I was shocked to see him. He said something like \"Surprised to see me?\" In other dreams, it made sense at first to see him, and the realization that he was gone only set in later, or after I woke up. But this dream mostly felt like it would to suddenly see a younger Corby standing there in real life. I put it together and said \"They can't see you, can they?\" He shook his head and pointed towards the back of the store. \n\nI threaded my way through the students and followed him while we walked through the rows of books. I told him how good it was to see him, and asked what it was like to be dead. I don't think I asked what it was like to be a ghost -- I think we understood a difference between those things in the dream. Corby was dead, but that was something he could experience, and he was letting me see him.\n\nHe thought for a moment. Taking a beat to think real hard before talking was a classic Corby gesture. He was always much more taciturn than me, which was almost unfairly charming when it combined with his excellent sense of humor. \"Ok it's like this,\" he said. \"When you were in Glasgow\" -- here he pronounced it with a comical Scottish accent, \"did you ever have to go out in the rain with a cold?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Lots of times, probably.\"\n\n\"It's not, like, something you'd do if you didn't have to, but something about it can be really nice, right? Like a certain kind of comfortable that you can't feel otherwise.\"\n\nI wasn't used to Corby talking so specifically about feelings and sensations, but I really got what he was saying. I knew exactly that feeling. \"Yeah!\"\n\nHe said, \"It's like that, but you can choose what kind of cold you have.\"\n\nI don't remember what else we talked about, but the whole time, I felt *so strongly* like I was talking to Corby, and not what I was thinking about Corby. My memory is very spatial, and I think in a literal sense, my memory of the bookstore is filled with ghosts of conversations with Corby, and it feels good to realize that that well isn't dry, that my mind can reach back and grab onto that feeling so completely. When he had to go, I told him how much I missed him, and how good it was to have known him. How he would have loved to meet Martha. I find myself having a lot of dreams lately where I get a chance to say the things I wish I could say to people in my past. Maybe that's a middle-age thing, mabe that's a 2024 thing, or maybe it's just happening. In any case, I'm going to be holding on to that feeling, firmly but lightly, of catching up with Corby in Dawn Treader Books today as M and I host about 15 people for Friendsgiving.",
      "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The <a class='internal-link' href='/development-log/'>Development Log</a> has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend <a class='internal-link' href='/ryan/'>Ryan</a>, who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least <a class='internal-link' href='/evan/'>one friend</a> into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Digital Gardens  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and <a class='internal-link' href='/tag/cozyweb/'>cozyweb</a>.\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  astronomy-picture-of-the-day  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  public-domain-review  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  the-morning-news  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s excellent <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  bookmarks  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader.",
      "# Brain Mulch and Mind Things\n\nIf only to be less confusing when I ramble about digital gardens and memexes and so on to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, I've been trying to figure out a clear difference between the two ideas, or at least how I'm approaching them.\n\nDigital Gardening seems more geared towards <a class='internal-link' href='/brain-mulch/'>Brain Mulch</a> -- notes about stuff, bookmarks or saved thoughts or links, encouraged to build up, ferment, and grow into more thinglike-things, but remain content with the mulching process.\n\n### On \"knowledge management\"\n\n> One thing I learned trying that for a year is that the specter of PKM or \"personal knowledge management\" that looms over all these ideas makes me want to barf. The public-note-taking part of it feels performative and is a terrible fit for my existing, useful research processes. It feels more like Digital Monoculture Hydroponics instead of gardening, crammed into a pyramid scheme where everyone's just writing about how much more productive they are with their projects (which are mainly writing about how productive they are). Also, I swear there's a PKM-to-Jordan-Peterson pipeline. bah.\n\nThat said, by writing this I'm *currently* enjoying some new benefits of the idea of public note taking. I'm not super intent on other people reading this and caring, but the idea that they might feels like it's tightening up my thinking, like cooking a quick meal for another person instead of just your self. And my chain of messy, three-quarters-finished documents that I chucked into Garden 1.0 did help me figure some stuff out to get here. On the flip side, I can't ever see a benefit to making public the version of that I have for painting -- a sprawling, decade-old set of documents I just call \"Studio Journal.\"\n\n### A Goal:\n\nJust for me, I would love to connect everything I have that's *like* my studio journal, across the spectrum of private to public, so that I have the biggest pile of Brain Mulch I can make, and that it's easy to extract sharable Mind Things when they come up.\n\n## Puttin in mind things\n\nMany of the things that make me go \"I should put that in the memex\" are familiar entries in my brain, things I refer back to often. Decided to call these <a class='internal-link' href='/mind-things/'>Mind Things</a>. (I think Brain Mulch is where you can grow new Mind Things?) After enough years of changing devices or changing where I put things online the idea that there could be even semi-complete feeling, navigable *external* archive of the shelves and galleries in my brain that I consult in the studio or in conversation when I'm writing is, like, **the** main reason I'm building this. Jeez that would be nice.\n\nI think the sense that most options are built on damp sand, as it were, has prevented me from really ever using any platform to its fullest potential. I'm always impressed when someone can do that. Feels like <a class='internal-link' href='/case/'>Case</a> has accomplished that. So I think I have *many* collections that are entirely in my head that *feel* like they're a real thing out in the world, but then I try to send my friends a link and the dream evaporates. (If any of you read that and were like \"yeah, me too\", *please do share!*)\n\n\n\n**An example:** For a long time I've had a notion of The Shelf -- the idea that everyone has a set of core texts that have shaped the way they see the world, or at the very least come up all the time.

      "In January of 2024 I had a dream in which my dear friend Gina was known to always be carrying, and snacking from, a basket of Dorians. Dorians, as everyone in the world of the dream already knew, were a beloved European cookie, as reknowned and revered as the Madelines and Financiers of our world.\n\n> Now, before I describe them, I have to admit that I have been talking about them with Martha and our friends so intently  (*fig 1*) since this dream that what follows is not a direct account of my dream as much as it is a confection of the collective, half-awake dream of Dorians that my friends and I have cultivated.\n\n![A set of texts describing the lore of Dorains as: Papa would always take me to Monsieur Dorian's bakery on the way to the trolly stop in winter and i would open the wax paper packet while looking out the window of the tram as the city flew by and the smell of warm almond, fresh orange, and dark chocolate would fill my cold, runny nose.](/assets/notes/dorian-fig-1.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1*\n\nBorn during the final days of the Austrio-Hungarian empire in a small family bakery (which, according to dream logic, was still operating out the of original location while simultaneously being long-since closed), Dorians were created to offer an uncompromisingly refined pastry experience that could be enjoyed by the cosmpolitan citizens on the go in the modern city, whether socialite, worker, child, artist, or nobility. They are a sandwich cookie consisting of two dense but airy almond flour discs, held together by a thin layer of chocolate ganache with hints of orange zest. The top cookie has a circular hole in the center, like a Linzer cookie, which holds extra ganache. In the dream they were served individually wrapped in a clamshell of two pieces of wax paper, crimped on the sides like a muffin wrapper. The top piece had an ornate, art-nouveau design stamped in pale green or orange, sinuous vines and snake-like ornaments surrounding the word \"Dorians\" in stylized letters in the center.\n\n![A basket with a stack of Dorian cookies in wax paper wrappers](/assets/notes/dorians-in-basket.jpeg)\n\nLike espresso, they are meant to be enjoyed on the go -- not idly munched, but savored in a brief lacunae between the demands of the day. They are said to be best shortly after cooling -- neither too soft nor too stale, so they were baked throughout the day in small batches. Only one batch per day of \"Famous Dorians\" would be made, which were fully covered in a shell of chocolate. In many cities, these were almost all reserved for the children of influential citizens and for the classier brothels, which would serve them to their regulars with a shot of chartreuse.\n\nThough a simple recipe and sold at a modest but fair price, Dorians provided a sophisticated moment of private delight to anyone who stopped to buy one after glimpsing a fresh batch in the window on their way to and from appointments in their cosmopolitan life.\n\nThanks to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, we can see what Dorians look like today. Thanks to me and excitement at being surprised with real Dorians on my birthday, we can only see what half of one looks like.\n\n![Half a Dorian cookie in a wax paper envelope.](/assets/notes/dorian-snack.jpeg)\n\nThese are almond sable held together with chocolate ganache dressed with wisps of candied orange peel in the center. Three  changes from my dream that Martha made that I highly approve of are the square, open envelopes, the candied orange peel, and the egg wash on the top cookie. I think these all make sense.\n\n- the open envelope says, yes, these are to-go, but not to be thrown in a purse or a pocket and forgotten about. They are to be eaten on-your-way\n- the candied orange peel is an excellent dash of extra luxury\n- An egg-wash is not something my dream brain knows about, and it is something that actual pastry chefs do know about and recommend. Maybe it even makes them less crumbly?\n\nShe surprised me with these for my 43rd birthday, and the first bite was incredible!\n\nWe will make more so that perhaps one day, all of you can enjoy a Dorian.\n\n",
      "![A washed out photo taken at night of a very old dark smear of something organic on the sidewalk with the photographer's two feet just visible in the bottom of the frame.](/assets/notes/the-sweet-potato-aug-6-2023.jpeg)\n> The Street Potato as of August 6, 2023\n\nMartha and I were at the <a class='internal-link' href='/worker-s-tap/'>Worker's Tap</a> with <a class='internal-link' href='/andrea/'>Andrea</a> talking about the micro-neighborhood of the four square blocks that encompass the Tap, her house, and our place. I mentioned The Street Potato in that way you remove detail when talking about something that has an extensive entry in your brain but you are talking to someone who might not know what you're talking about or possibly think you're somewhat crazy if you talked about it in the detail you think of it. To be clear -- I *knew* Andrea would be down with it, but didn't want to assume she had noticed it.\n\n\"Oh you mean the one up on Ankeny??\"\n\nYeah, she had noticed it.\n\nInstantly, all three of us dropped our filters and started comparing notes about the life of The Street Potato in full detail.\n\nThe Street Potato lives (died?) on a short block lined by two generic, new-construction apartment buildings. The building to the north has a half-block-long garage door and a bunch of balconies full of stuff but never people. The smaller building to the south has a row of street-level windows, most of which have a cat or evidence of a cat in them. On the sidewalk in front of the row of cat windows, some time in the early spring -- possibly even the late winter -- a large, apparently-cooked sweet potato appeared on the sidewalk. At least half of it was somewhat *in* the sidewalk -- stomped or splattered into the concrete such that The Street Potato was not about to roll away. Since then, it appears to have taken up permanent residence in that spot.\n\n\n### My theory of The Street Potato\n\n\n**I think it was thrown or otherwise ejected from a window**\n\nEvidence:\n- I believe about 75% of it flattened upon contact with the sidewalk.\n- The force to de-cohere so much of a good-sized sweet potato requires more acceleration than it would get by simply being dropped from the carrying height of an average adult.\n- It landed about ten feet from the building, farther than it would have if it simply fell.\n- This also means it was probably fully cooked.\n\n**It embodies the universe's infinite capacity for change.**\n\n- As *I* recall, it started out as recognizable sweet potato, sticking out of the sidewalk like it had clipped through it in a video game.\n- Someone stepped on it within the first few weeks of its life on the sidewalk.\n\t- This means they were probably looking at a cute cat in the window, or the abject  emptiness of the giant garage door.\n- Since being stepped on, it has been functionally two-dimensional.\n- It is at least 4 months old.\n\t- I am writing this in August. It was definitely there in April. I don't know what this means.\n\n<a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> has a different theory -- the potato fell from a bag while being carried to or from some sort of dinner function, and the potato-dropper immediately slipped in the potato, grinding it into the sidewalk, perhaps with the classic slapstick slipping-on-a-banana pratfall.\n\n",

      "![Two red paintings](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-060323-5.jpeg)\n\nAmy is a friend of me and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, and a treasure of Portland's painting scene. Martha's been working at Nationale since we moved back, so we were both really stoked when Amy had a solo show there. Martha even had the pleasure of writing her exhibition statement.\n\nThe exhibition was a real knockout, especially if you've been following Amy's work for a while. Some of the pieces really felt like they'd been slowly growing for a long time, like the thickets of abundance they depicted. It felt a little like coming back to a familiar patch of forest or a trail after a couple seasons of growth. It's the place you remember, but you keep noticing evidence of the unseen force that animates it.\n\n[Here's the official documentation from Nationale](https://www.nationale.us/amy-bay-they-always-have-and-still-do-2023)\n\nAmy also gave a wonderful talk towards the end of the run of the show. She has a way of talking about her practice and the work of painting in general that is really refreshing and comfortable. It feels like she has done the work, loves the work, and has a healthy respect for the difficulty of it. And she's got the same sort of calm clarity of observation in how she talks about painting that she has in her visual depictions. So it was a good talk overall, but it was extra satisfying to hear her confirm and expand on some of the vibes I picked up. She and May (owner of Nationale) joked about the arc of changes for certain paintings between studio visits, and ended up pointing out some specific formal qualities that were new in this show.\n\n![Amy Speaking at the show](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-070623.jpeg)\nThat was something really satisfying that reminds me what's valuable about close looking or listening to artists talk about their work or good criticism or even just doing a little more research than swiping through images on Instagram. Like, that new-growth feeling I had was very present but hard to describe -- remarkable but ineffable. And I suppose I could have sat down with documentation of Amy's previous work and done some degree of comparative cataloguing and come up with some formal qualities that describe the differences. But that's not how we usually engage with paintings, and even when people have paid me to do that in writing it can take an unwieldy amount of time to get anywhere with it.\n\nBut when Amy was like \"yeah this might be the first painting of mine with a horizon line\" or pointed out that there's a semi-intentional diptych in the show, or talked at length about the mysterious insistence of the dark flower in the center of one of the most striking pieces -- those are some of those really rewarding moments of taking art seriously. I don't need everything noticeable to be explainable, but when you hear someone articulate the thing you noticed, that you keep thinking about but not in words, it's like this bridge between parts of your brain that I feel like we're generally discouraged from connecting. \n\n::::\n\nI thought I was going to write about the surfaces of these paintings more, but maybe I'll do that another time. (Which makes me think of the thesis of <a class='internal-link' href='/patterns-of-intention/'>Patterns of Intention</a>.) Amy does really cool stuff with cold wax medium, scumbling, and very thin washes of color that makes these rich surfaces that feel organic while remaining very much just paint. \n\n\n\ncheck out the gallery here: <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/they-always-have-and-still-do/'>They Always Have and Still Do</a>"

      "DOES THIS WORK [cozyweb][#cozyweb]???\n\nHOW BOUT DIS\n  <octo-thorpe>\n    digitalGardens\n  </octo-thorpe>\n---\n\nSHRUGGIE\n\nI had a 15 mile hiking day in <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  canyonlands  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and thought about digital gardens until my brain melted. I dumped my thoughts about this project on <a class='internal-link' href='/nik/'>Nik</a> and he dumped them back in a [much prettier pile](https://garden.nikolas.ws/thinking-about-octothorpes/).\n\n\n[Social Web Protocol is interesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols)\n\n[DBPedia would be cool if it worked](https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org)\n\n# 5.9.2022\n\nHad a chance to look at [Dorian Taylor's](https://doriantaylor.com) library of[ RDF for Ruby](https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak) stuff. <a class='internal-link' href='/nik/'>Nik</a> is super into his stuff, and have chatted with him briefly because of this on twitter. Obvs knows a lot about all of this.\n\nOverall, my interest in digital gardens is I'm trying to stick to \"what goes in the frame\" than \"how is the frame built\". Of course, the whole octothorpe idea is very, very much a frame idea. With that in mind, and with the world benefitting from excellent frame-makers like Dorian, my hunch is that I want an in-the-middle approach like so:\n\n* Leave the website making to the things that make websites -- Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, whatever\n* It's ok for people to use their website-makers to make connections and meaning on their website in their usual way\n* Use the RDF layer to do all the mapping / relating / remaking\n\n### This means:\n\n* Any RDF and linked-data patterns should be able to read the cliff-notes version of this meaning and these connections (ie a Jekyll plugin that can convert tags / layouts to metadata)\n* I think the canonical urls for a markdown-based SSG should be raw markdown files with rich frontmatter\n* Octothorpes is a service that doesn't care how your site is made, and expects to look at markdown files like that\n* Lightweight plugins / converters maintined within the ecosystems of website-makers take care of going from Their Way of Doing Things to producing these canonical markdown files\n* How much metadata goes into a human-readable public url is decided within the website-making step\n* Octothorpes as a service a human would use does the following:\n\t* parses and associates the meaning of the metadata on canonical urls with the content (markdown) within an namespace\n\t* generates the relevant JSON-LD for that namespace\n\t* coordinates / distributes resources like the plugins that a SSG would use to hook into the Octothorpoes ecostytem\n\t* provides JS interfaces for the core features of the Octothorpes ecosystem to plunk in on sites that don't use / have access to the above plugins ^. Eg:\n\t\t* simple D3-like graph visualization of related content\n\t\t* in-line activation of \"octothorped\" terms\n\t\t* backlinks\n\t* provides an infinite and growing set of visualizations, connections, remixes, etc from it's galaxy of linked data... lalaal whatever this is the \"future is bright / open source everything\" part of the roadmap\n\t\t* *This* step is where you would generate actual webpages from pure RDF / OWL / JSON-LD whathave you. This is fine, but I don't think we should *start* there.\n\n\nSo this represents a pretty big departure from Dorian's project. His swiss-army knife is super cool and interesting, but too unwieldy to carry in your pocket everywhere\n\nI'm lookin [at this stuff](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/). Ecosystem seems healthy and well maintained.\n\n# 12.26.22\n\nWe wrote version 1 in our heads, so why not make a spec for Version 2 before we actually write it in code\n\n\n# Octothorpes\n\nOctothorpes is a lightweight protocol for creating bidirectional links and event streams between documents, regardless of whether the documents are accessible via local or networked protocols. The octothorpe ecosystem consists of:\n\n* documents\n\t* content\n\t* yaml frontmatter\n* an octothorpes parser\n* an octothorpes server\n\nWrite **documents** in plaintext or markdown, describe them with basic YAML frontmatter.\nRun an octothorpes parser to create meaningful records that describe the documents and their relationships to other records.\n\n> A Parser runs in the same environment where you access the documents. For example, if you were writing documents in markdown files on your own machine, you would use the Octothorpes CLI. If you are writing them in Wordpress on a public blog, you would use an embedded script or Wordpress plugin.\n\n**An Octothorpes parser** creates descriptive RDF records for each of your documents. These records can contain the full content of your documents, or simply a reference to a canonical source of a document's content. Parsers deal with the following entities:\n\n* Document records\n* Backlinks \n* Octothorpe Terms (also known simply as `octothorpes`)\n* User terms\n\n\n### Octothorpes server\n\n\nConnect your parser to an **octothorpe server** to relate your parsed documents to other documents and terms. A `server` reads the RDF created by parsers and provides an API for interacting with that information. Octothorpe servers respond to requests for all of the above entities and handle the following **Events**\n\n* [All ActivityPub actions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n* Sync\n* Transform\n* Feed\n\n## Entities\n\n\n### Document records\n\nParsing a document creates a descriptive record of a document that is treated as a permanent ID for that document in the Octothorpes ecosystem. \n\n> todo: document spec.\n> I think docs should only require title, alias, terms, mode (r,w,x), and content (reference or canonical)\n> but feels like more thinking is required.\n\n**Canonical document records**\n\nOptionally, the content of a document can be stored in the document record and treated as the canonical version. Separate files or URLS can be created from a canonical document record via Events, according to access rights a Server has to the environment in which those files exist. Setting a document record's mode to `read-write` requires converting it to a `CDR`. `CDRs` could also be used when moving a set of documents to a new environment, preventing accidental editing of a document, or, conversely, if your preferred method of editing a document is with a (currently nonexistent) document record editor application.\n\n\n### Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are bidirectional links between documents. Since Octothorpes uses RDF descriptions of your documents, these *can* be hyperlinks but *don't have to be.* A backlink is simply a bidirectional relationship between any two documents the Octothorpes Server can identify. An octothorpes server includes backlink relationship information with any request for a document, and can respond to direct requests for backlink nodes.\n\n> todo: resolve backlink concept with activitypub \n> maybe a good [ref here](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-activitypub)?\n\n### Octothorpe Terms\nWhereas backlinks describe a relationship between documents, Octothorpe Terms -- or simply `octothorpes` -- describe a relationship between a document and a universal term. A document that is octothorped with the term `#octothorpe` has a potential relationship to every other accessible document with the same octothorpe. \n\n**Browsing and following octothorpes**\n\nOctothorpe servers provide an API for all the terms and documents they know about. If this API is made public, it can be subscribed to or manually interacted with via ActivityStreams / ActivityPub protocols, or a `feed` request.\n\n> Example: Nik subscribes a private Octothorpes server (Server A) and subscribes to the popular public server octothorp.es. (Server B). Nim only subscribes to Server B, but  When Nik issues a request for the octothorpe `#wombats` he sees results from Servers A and B. Nim will only see results from Server B.  \n\n\n## User terms\nAn arbitrary number of terms can be associated with a document record. These can be as simple as plaintext tags or a full schema such as SKOS.\n\n> By default, Parsers should be able to read and write User terms as [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#object) and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n\n\n## Events\n\n**Sync** \n\n`Sync` is used to copy content between environments, according to the access rights of those environments.\n\nAssuming the user has appropriate rights and access in both the environment where the `Server` they `sync` to and the `Parser` that issues the request,the requested `server` will respond with the canonical content and all terms for the requested `document record`.\n\nThe `parser` which issued the `sync` request then creates an associated `document record` . Environment variables or request params can be used to set whether that `document record` uses the original as its canonical reference, creates a new file to reference, or creates a new `CDR` backlinked to the original `document record`. \n\nIf the `mode` is set to `read-write` a sync request can be sent with an `overwrite` flag, which will update the `document record` with the canonical content of a separate `document record.` \n\n**Transform**\n\n`transform` is a read-only version of `sync` that can map `document record` attributes to an arbitrary set of outputs according to schema definitions provided to the `parser` in the form of JSON / JSON-LD. This is mainly a convenience function for `parsers`, as the response from the `server` will be the same as a `sync` request, but upon success will trigger further work by the `parser` that issued the request, according to env variables, request params, and schema definitions. \n\n> Example 1: Nim writes documents in Obsidian and publishes them on a Jekyll site. Both allow backlinking via alias but use different terms to define the alias. He sets up a simple schema definition that converts the `alias` term to a `title` term. He then uses the Octothorpes CLI to `transform` documents within his working directory using the `obsidian-jekyll` schema, outputting them as markdown files in his specified Jekyll directory. \n> Example 2: Retweet the web. Nik reads an article he likes on a blog that provides public `document records` for each of its articles. Using a bookmarklet authenticated to his private `server`, he can send a `transform` request to his server which will convert the `document record` of the blog article he's reading into a document format that his own website uses, creating a `backlink` to the original `document record` in the process.\n\n**Feed**\n\nThe `feed` request will create an rss/xml/whatever feed based on request parameters or `server` defaults when sent. \n\n> Example: Nik and Nim create a shared, private `server` that they both `sync` their notes to. They don't feel like creating a website, but they want to share what they're working on. So they set a public endpoint for `feed?authors=Nik-nim&format=rss-rdf` that allows anyone to subscribe via RSS. Of course, the feed includes well-formed `document records` by default, so anyone running their own `server` locally can easily `transform` that feed into any format they want.\n\n## 10.28.23\n\nFinally reading my paper copy of Literary Machines properly after showing the memex to my sister.\n\nmisread the instructions on how to navigate the book as having multiple levels of significant underlining. as in a double or single underline have distinct meaning. maybe octothorpe notation is a double underline?\n\n[#cozyweb]: https://octothorp.es/~/cozyWeb?/=tag/cozyweb"

      "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The <a class='internal-link' href='/development-log/'>Development Log</a> has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend <a class='internal-link' href='/ryan/'>Ryan</a>, who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least <a class='internal-link' href='/evan/'>one friend</a> into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Digital Gardens  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and <a class='internal-link' href='/tag/cozyweb/'>cozyweb</a>.\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  astronomy-picture-of-the-day  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  public-domain-review  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  the-morning-news  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s excellent <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  bookmarks  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader."

    "excerpt": "<p><a href=\"https://shop.dawntreaderbooks.com/?page_id=17\">Dawn Treader</a> is a bookstore in Ann Arbor, founded in 1976. [[Corby]] ran it for years and always let me work there when I ended up back in Ann Arbor for some dumb reason or another as a 20-something. After he passed away, Africa Schuamann, who had been manager for a while, really took over and <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2023/08/new-owner-of-dawn-treader-continues-legacy-for-longtime-ann-arbor-book-shop.html?outputType=amp\">eventually bought the place</a>. She’s really done right by the place, including replacing the awful florescent lights with classy pendant lights. She was also the one who let us in to the basement to rescue Corby’s years of rude collages.</p>\n",

      "The first bookstore I worked at was <a class='internal-link' href='/dawn-treader-books/'>Dawn Treader Books</a>, a classic, all-topics used bookstore (with a particularly strong showing in fiction, especially science fiction). I was 17, and I had also recently started volunteering at WCBN, the community radio station. \n\nThis was the late 90s, and while I had done some internetting, it was still a remarkable thing to be surrounded by stacks of media. We were still more than a decade from being always within reach of a device with the ability to drown us in content. So these huge collections of books and records and CDs were magical in a way that's kind of hard to remember. Also, I was 17 and basically an idiot, so there was lots to discover.\n\nSomething kept happening at the bookstore or the radio station that made them seem extra magical. I'd somehow stumble across a book I had just read about in the last book I was reading, or an album that turned out to be the first project by members of the last band I really got into. Things like that.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that, while I wasn't looking for these, I was very actively rejecting other books and records literally by the _thousands_. Simply by scanning the fiction section, being paid minimum wage to shelve new arrivals, browsing the records at the station, I was _not_ picking up thousands of titles every week that didn't grab my attention. And then I was picking up dozens or maybe hundreds of other titles that didn't hold it. So this created this tremendous negative pressure that caused the important things to bubble to the top. \n\nMy career in used books ended when I went to art school seven years later, but I was into this idea enough that I consciously employed it in note taking and research for my dissertation. Or half-consciously, I guess -- you can't really do it on purpose.\n\nCan't say I've had a name for it this whole time, but it's an idea that feels solid to me. So if I'm gonna write it down let's call the phenomenon a slow-motion-bullseye. \n\nI think it's a nice motivation to stay curious -- keep up the curiosity and who knows how many perfect things to read or listen to or see are slowly approaching the bullseye of your attention from all angles!",
      "I had a really vivid dream last night involving my late friend Corby. Since he passed away in 2018, he's shown up in my dreams a few times, but as far as I remember he was alive in those dreams. In this dream he was a ghost, and he knew it and I knew it.\n\nCorby ran his family's bookstore, <a class='internal-link' href='/dawn-treader-books/'>Dawn Treader Books</a>. It's still going strong under really great new management. I was just in there last month on my last visit to Michigan for Pete's wedding. So I think the version I was working with in my dream was pretty current.\n\nI don't know how I found myself there, but I was having a hard time finding what I was looking for. That happened the last time I was there, but I know that feeling comes from the fact that for two decades of my life, I'd see Corby when I walked in and that still feels like how it should be. I left, but then realized I had left my 90's-style cellphone there. When I walked back in, a huge group of students in white shirts was collecting on the landing of the stairs at the entrance. With dream logic, the more there were, the bigger the landing got. I asked the person working the counter what was going on and they said that they were from a class at the art college very similar to the one that <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> is teaching right now, and that in a minute their professor would get there and they'd teach their class in the store. It felt strange and new and like I didn't belong.\n\nWhile I stood there thinking, Corby just walked up, writing either a price or a duplicate card for the paperback he had in his hand. He looked like he did when he was in better health. Unlike other dreams, I was shocked to see him. He said something like \"Surprised to see me?\" In other dreams, it made sense at first to see him, and the realization that he was gone only set in later, or after I woke up. But this dream mostly felt like it would to suddenly see a younger Corby standing there in real life. I put it together and said \"They can't see you, can they?\" He shook his head and pointed towards the back of the store. \n\nI threaded my way through the students and followed him while we walked through the rows of books. I told him how good it was to see him, and asked what it was like to be dead. I don't think I asked what it was like to be a ghost -- I think we understood a difference between those things in the dream. Corby was dead, but that was something he could experience, and he was letting me see him.\n\nHe thought for a moment. Taking a beat to think real hard before talking was a classic Corby gesture. He was always much more taciturn than me, which was almost unfairly charming when it combined with his excellent sense of humor. \"Ok it's like this,\" he said. \"When you were in Glasgow\" -- here he pronounced it with a comical Scottish accent, \"did you ever have to go out in the rain with a cold?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Lots of times, probably.\"\n\n\"It's not, like, something you'd do if you didn't have to, but something about it can be really nice, right? Like a certain kind of comfortable that you can't feel otherwise.\"\n\nI wasn't used to Corby talking so specifically about feelings and sensations, but I really got what he was saying. I knew exactly that feeling. \"Yeah!\"\n\nHe said, \"It's like that, but you can choose what kind of cold you have.\"\n\nI don't remember what else we talked about, but the whole time, I felt *so strongly* like I was talking to Corby, and not what I was thinking about Corby. My memory is very spatial, and I think in a literal sense, my memory of the bookstore is filled with ghosts of conversations with Corby, and it feels good to realize that that well isn't dry, that my mind can reach back and grab onto that feeling so completely. When he had to go, I told him how much I missed him, and how good it was to have known him. How he would have loved to meet Martha. I find myself having a lot of dreams lately where I get a chance to say the things I wish I could say to people in my past. Maybe that's a middle-age thing, mabe that's a 2024 thing, or maybe it's just happening. In any case, I'm going to be holding on to that feeling, firmly but lightly, of catching up with Corby in Dawn Treader Books today as M and I host about 15 people for Friendsgiving."

      "Walking up to <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s recent art show at <a class='internal-link' href='/mother-foucault-s/'>Mother Foucault's</a>, I saw [*Patterns of Intention*](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300037630/patterns-of-intention/) in the window. They're distressingly good at putting books I want in the window -- I think 90% of the books I've bought there have come from the window. Or maybe I'm just a lazy browser and need to literally see it from the street to pay attention.\n\nAt the moment, I'm still trying to figure out why and where from I know this book. I might have cited it before, or seen it cited, or something. Baxandall has certainly come up before.

I'm automatically on board with one of the central ideas, that when we describe images we are mostly making statements about the description -- we can't assume that there's this special unbroken connection between the nature of the painting and the things we're saying about it. This is very conceptual-labor-y -- that we're working with our model of the image, and can refine it to get closer to the \"actual\" image, but never escape it.\n\nWas on my mind when writing about <a class='internal-link' href='/amy-bay-at-nationale/'>Amy Bay at Nationale</a>.

      "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n"

I mentioned The Street Potato in that way you remove detail when talking about something that has an extensive entry in your brain but you are talking to someone who might not know what you're talking about or possibly think you're somewhat crazy if you talked about it in the detail you think of it. To be clear -- I *knew* Andrea would be down with it, but didn't want to assume she had noticed it.\n\n\"Oh you mean the one up on Ankeny??\"\n\nYeah, she had noticed it.\n\nInstantly, all three of us dropped our filters and started comparing notes about the life of The Street Potato in full detail.\n\nThe Street Potato lives (died?) on a short block lined by two generic, new-construction apartment buildings. The building to the north has a half-block-long garage door and a bunch of balconies full of stuff but never people. The smaller building to the south has a row of street-level windows, most of which have a cat or evidence of a cat in them. On the sidewalk in front of the row of cat windows, some time in the early spring -- possibly even the late winter -- a large, apparently-cooked sweet potato appeared on the sidewalk. At least half of it was somewhat *in* the sidewalk -- stomped or splattered into the concrete such that The Street Potato was not about to roll away. Since then, it appears to have taken up permanent residence in that spot.\n\n\n### My theory of The Street Potato\n\n\n**I think it was thrown or otherwise ejected from a window**\n\nEvidence:\n- I believe about 75% of it flattened upon contact with the sidewalk.\n- The force to de-cohere so much of a good-sized sweet potato requires more acceleration than it would get by simply being dropped from the carrying height of an average adult.\n- It landed about ten feet from the building, farther than it would have if it simply fell.\n- This also means it was probably fully cooked.\n\n**It embodies the universe's infinite capacity for change.**\n\n- As *I* recall, it started out as recognizable sweet potato, sticking out of the sidewalk like it had clipped through it in a video game.\n- Someone stepped on it within the first few weeks of its life on the sidewalk.\n\t- This means they were probably looking at a cute cat in the window, or the abject  emptiness of the giant garage door.\n- Since being stepped on, it has been functionally two-dimensional.\n- It is at least 4 months old.\n\t- I am writing this in August. It was definitely there in April. I don't know what this means.\n\n<a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> has a different theory -- the potato fell from a bag while being carried to or from some sort of dinner function, and the potato-dropper immediately slipped in the potato, grinding it into the sidewalk, perhaps with the classic slapstick slipping-on-a-banana pratfall.\n\n",

If you made a pie by hand you can take credit for its deliciousness. You wave off compliments if it’s store-bought. But just as handmade pies lean on the qualities of their ingredients, even the most handmade of images are inseparable from the physical, non-human properties of the tools and materials that someone’s hands used in the making. How much we let those properties matter in our reading of an image depends on where we locate the “art” of the process; i.e. where we expect the presence of an artist doing art in a way that matters to the image.</p>\n",

      "There was a particularly strong thread that ran through most of my conversations at [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) this year. It was braided from questions (pleas?) like the following:\n\n- what's wrong with the internet now\n- can we make it not poisonous again\n- could we even make it fun again\n- what about all those sites we used to make for ouselves\n- how can we find the people and communities doing that now\n\nBefore the talks, this wasn't much of a surprise. I was there in large part to talk about these things! Nik and I had purposely busted ass to get [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es/) ready to share because XOXO seemed like the biggest gathering we could find of people who would get it. (Briefly, Octothorpes are hashtags and backlinks you can use on independent sites. You can read *a lot more* starting from [the guide we made for XOXO.](https://octothorp.es/xoxo2024.html)) I had just written essays called [We really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/) and  [We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-got-used-to-talking-to-the-internet-itself-instead-of-people-on-the-internet/) as a way of explaining why we were making Octothorpes. So this was on my mind.\n\nWe hoped to find a few people who were asking similar questions. I was *not* expecting that nearly everyone I talked to was likely to bring these questions up *first*. And when they seemed to form a powerful, unifying chain of critique and inquiry and hope through the main talks... I think I actually pumped my fist in the air a few times.\n\n\n## Tracing the thread\n\nSome points on the line, in chronological order:\n\n*note: most of these quotes are from memory. Once the recordings of the talks are posted I'll link to them and correct anything here. Feel free to correct me if you have notes.*\n\n[Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com/) says \"**Indie is just an economic descriptor**\" in his funny, insightful talk about the highs and lows of trying to make it building independent projects and communities on the internet, in part as a followup to his 2014 talk \"[How I Won The Lottery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw)\" This was to say that it's a way of existing in the market, rather than a coherent aesthetic or a value system, and it can be liberating or fuck you up in equal measures.\n\nSomeone? says something to the effect \"**We used to do weird things on the internet and then at some point it started doing weird things to us?**” Interestingly, when I tried to clarify who said this on the XOXO slack, it was clear that this could be considered one of the main themes of the festival. Someone else asked Andy Baio, one of the organizers, if this was on purpose. He responded that, while he had themes in mind when inviting speakers, they were ultimately in control of their own talks. He didn't even see the talks before they presented live, so this solid theme we felt mostly came together organically.\n\nDefinitely [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/) asked the room to **remember the time they felt embodied excitement, like in the pit of their stomach, about making something on the internet**. Her example was building her user profile page (called a lookup) on Neopets. She challenged us to find that feeling again with what we do now. The crowd was stoked.\n\n[Erin Kissane](https://erinkissane.com/), with great generosity and attention, told her story of gathering countless friends and strangers via the internet to process early COVID data. How it became the foundation for whatever public understanding we had of the pandemic, and what that community of purpose meant to her. This structured her nuanced critique of the current state of the internet. She implored us not to take a \"dark forest\" approach in leaving the sites of the current online toxicity. Both so these networks of care and shared concern could still form in public, and so that there was somewhere for those who come next to go. Instead, she gave us the rallying cry **Fix the fucking networks.** It's a line that I know many people in the last week or so have written down in their own accounts and web logs.\n\n[Ed Yong's](https://edyong.me/) moving, personal talk brought it home about both what one could do with the internet and what it could do to you. It was so open-hearted and immediate and personal that I don't really feel like I can or should try to summarize it here, only to say that when I do post the video you should definitely watch it all. In it, he said something along the lines that **we'll look back on the era where we put our random thoughts online for milions of strangers to read like we look back on when we built houses with asbestos.** This was greeted with ripples of laughter and then applause, filtered through I believe both relief and regret.\n\nOur through-line so far, paraphrased:\n\n- Indie just means out there on your own. And that can be pretty hard.\n- We used to do weird things on the internet, and now it does weird things to us.\n- Try to remember when making things on the internet felt creative and exciting.\n- We need to fix the fucking networks if we want to hang on to that feeling, and be safe out there on our own, while still being able to find each other.\n- Massive social media feeds are acute *and* chronic health hazards.\n\nSo, the way people talked about \"being on the internet\" at the last XOXO, in 2019, felt, uhh, *different* than this. This felt like a \"Frogs that jumped out of the pot[^1]\" conference. A \"How do we deal with the fact that society and most of our livlihoods have oriented themselves to this boiling pot of water that towers over our every waking moment while all we want to do is hop around and catch flies?\"\n## Next -- the IndieWeb becomes or remains discourse\n\nWhile mulling this all over in the last week, I came across some posts, on independent blogs, that seemed to be part of this zeitgeist for the open internet. They were both for small and personal websites and critical of some of the largest current projects working towards independent and non-commercial internet spaces, the IndieWeb and Fediverse movements.\n\nRoughly in order that I read them:\n\n- [Yelling at Clouds](https://manuelmoreale.com/yelling-at-the-web-clouds) by Manuel Morale\n- [IndieWeb's 3 Body Problem](https://so1o.xyz/blog/3-body-problem) by Solo\n- [Smaller](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/smaller/) by Simone Silvestroni\n- [Has the IndieWeb become Irrelevant](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html) by Matthew Graybosch\n- [The Social Web](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-social-web) by Manuel Morale\n\nAnd responses from the IndieWeb community:\n- [Has the IndieWeb become discourse again?](https://martymcgui.re/2024/08/29/141602/) by Marty McGuire\n- [Ownership, connection, and control](https://json.blog/2024/08/29/ownership-connection-and.html) by Jason Becker\n\n\nA lot of it is inside-baseball for a small community, and I don't even think it registers on the internet drama scale. I agree with a many of the specific points from the critical side, enough that I'm already building something that I think aligns with many of them, but I also agree with much of the responses from the IndieWeb community, who are all, in all of my experience, friendly, welcoming, and open minded people. If this is stuff you already care about, I do encourage you to read all these posts. But, with the thread from XOXO running through my thoughts, here's a summary of what I thought was most compelling from these posts.\n\n- If you want to be an individual who writes stuff on a website who talks to other individuals about it, email, a webpage, and RSS do really well for that. You might not need more than that.\n- We should critically assess the benefits of integration between \"websites\" and \"platforms\"\n- The Fediverse largely reproduces patterns designed by corporate social media, just with a better ownership model. Let's critically assess those patterns.\n- However accessible non-commercial internet authorship tools are trying to be, a lot of people -- perhaps most -- still find the bar too high.\n- No one can agree on what \"IndieWeb\" or \"indie web\" really means\n- We're even having a hard time agreeing what \"the social web\" means\n\nHere's what stuck out to me about the *context* in which these posts are being discussed:\n\n- These posts are all in conversation, almost all of them from the last few weeks, on static, self-made websites, and most of the authors insist on email as the main channel of response.\n- People are having substantive conversations about a topic that matters to them, and being pretty articulate, nuanced, and respectful about it even when they're disagreeing. \n- The posts have reached people outside of the author's immediate community without the authors promoting them on any platforms\n\n\nReading this conversation felt like hearing from frogs that got out of the pot before it got warm. I think, in general, those are good people to listen to in whatever context you encounter them. But...\n\nIt is very easy to go, fuck yeah, out with the new, in with the old, let's make the internet sane and quiet and small. But... \n\nIt's very hard to balance that with Erin Kissane's call to action. As she said in her talk, she and her army of volunteers should never have had to step in to do the work we expect our governments to do in a pandemic. But now we have the tools for citizens to self-organize *en masse* about issues they care about, so we should think very critically about dismantling them before the next pandemic. How do we balance these concerns?\n\n\n## The Active Web\n\nHere I am participating in discourse, in relatively real-time. How did I get into it? I saw a [post by Sarah Joy on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sarajw/113035847169727351) that linked to a post that linked to this. So a combination of the convenience of a social feed, and the small web's call to browse.\n\nThe double edged sword of convenience is that it's accessible, but it's also exploitable. In America, a \"convenience\" store is conveniently located, but it's also full of addictive substances. Nothing hates inconvenience more than addiction.\n\nSo maybe \"passive\" is a better watchword for what we're trying to change about the internet. After all, Erin Kissane wasn't talking about the importance of large networks of *passive* users consuming content. I think she was talking about the importance of maintaining a low bar for *engagement,* since the network she so valued was one of the most engaged collections of people on the internet ever. Also, I am not and have never been close to marketing, so I mean engagement as, like, you know, *engaging* with shit you care about. Not whatever else it ends up meaning.\n\nMastodon made it *convenient* for me to find this set of articles, but I had to actively engage with it to appreciate it.\n\nJason Becker says: \n\n *I am never going to get all of the people I’m connected to online to go back to using RSS. And I’m not going to get them to bookmark my webpage and visit it multiple times a day. They have places they consistently read feeds.*\n\n\nI don't think that's entirely true. I mean, no, not everyone. [Maybe not every post is for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2vejhdm8lo&t=49s) But I only read his post because I checked, for the third time, the website of a guy who checked Jason's website. Maybe no one's going to find and check your website without a reason, but I'm going to click through if I actually care about it, or if the link looks interesting. This is called *browsing* and I miss it.\n\nI feel like all these conversations and calls to action I hear have this in common; they're calling for an active and critical engagement with the internet -- what we put on it, how we build it, and how we use it to connect with other people. For some people that means writing your own CMS from scratch and federating all your posts to multiple services. For others it might mean making a mutual aid Facebook group. Or maybe just starting a text thread with friends. \n\nThere's a sort of \"cat's out of the bag, what comes next?\" vibe to a lot of these conversations. I definitely don't have the answer, but I've really appreciated the questions and challenges posed by all the sources I've posted here. This is what I'm hearing:\n\n- We want to be able to connect, broadly\n- We want a humane speed.\n- We don't just want moderation, we want a kind of internet that *can be moderated.* We might just want moderate internet.\n- We have been convinced that you can't scale if you ask people to *do something* to get to content, rather than just lining up to receive it.\n- We have been convinced that stuff has to scale.\n\n \nErin Kissane is challenging us to do something that can empower mass numbers of people without having to *harvest* mass numbers of people. That's definitely tricky.\n\nBut if this is where the conversation is at, I'm excited to see what comes next and will try hard to contribute meaningfully to it.\n\nThank you XOXO for making this conversation feel vital, spirited, and friendly.\n\nps OMG I almost forgot. One of the great things that came out of this zeitgeist already was Molly White putting out a call for personal blogs in the afterglow of the festival on the XOXO slack and getting [this treasure trove](https://gist.github.com/molly/e5003cfed284baf075c01e9470c089bc) back. That's your present for getting this far. ❌🅾️❌🅾️\n\n[^1]: In likening the experience of using the internet in the 21st century to frogs in a pot of boiling water, I should point out that frogs, and all other creatures with enough sense not to invent social media, actually do jump out. [Unless their higher functions have been taken away deliberately by the people controlling the experiment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog#cite_ref-23)",
      "![Screenshot from the webcomic Achewood showing Ray Smuckles, the cat, sending chat messages to his best friend Roast Beef using a custom chat app that Beef made called Ray_and_Beef_Chat 8.0](/assets/texts/ray-beef-chat.png)\n\nThis is my ideal DM experience. The `8.0` indicates so much *care.* (To be clear, entirely on Beef's part.)\n\n_(This is part two of <a class='internal-link' href='/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/'>We Really Like Personal Sites But the Internet Has Been Turning into Poisonous Garbage At An Alarming Rate</a>)_\n\nI have a rule on my phone, and it has always been this way. Only humans are allowed to make my phone ask for my attention. And only recently have I appreciated what horrors it has saved me from. The notifications I currently get are:\n\n- texts from humans (incl signal and whatsapp)\n- direct mentions or messages on slack or mastodon\n- ...uhh that's it\n\nI don't even get notifications from the private discord I host for my friends (I would but it seems broken and who am I to argue with it). I certainly don't get notifications from Instagram, even for DMs, for the same reason that if a friend wants to talk to me in a crowded bus station I will suggest we go outside first.\n\n## Notifications should come from People Not Apps\n\nPeople, not apps, deserve my spontaneous attention. I'm not going to explain why. I don't think I'm smart or special for doing it this way. I'm still waiting for someone to explain why it should be any other way. When I see a push notification for ᴄʜɪᴘᴏᴛʟᴇ x ᴊᴏᴊᴏ ꜱɪᴡᴀ ɪꜱ ᴄᴜʀʀᴇɴᴛʟʏ ʟɪᴠᴇ ᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀʟʟɢʀᴇᴇɴꜱ ᴇxᴘᴇʀɪᴇɴᴄᴇ appear on a friend's phone, I feel the same concern and desire to throw away their personal property that I would as if I found a tupperware labeled \"Fentanyl for later\" in their fridge. This comes from the same feral sense that makes us occasionally want to throw our phones in a lake.\n\nI'm not alone in trying to unpack what that feral sense needs. I think it's one of our few guideposts in the era of talking to the internet. Unlike my list of how the internet used to be, we don't really have a primordial era of notifications. We had email, chat rooms, text, and then smartphones and Facebook threw the sluice gates open. It's harder to parse which expectations for the social internet are sustainable and which are toxic, because they developed -- and are still developing -- largely in tandem with the ideas of the huge corporations that shoved social media into existence.\n\n\n### But also we want this\n\nThe biggest thing missing from my \"back in my day\" list was socializing. As in *socializing on* the internet, as opposed to \"because I got invited to something through the internet.\" One could argue that this was better, but one would be arguing with a rising sea. And of course the line between our online and irl social lives has been blurred beyond notice for years now. And we all have had real, treasured, human experiences that were only possible because of the internet. My late friend Corby had chronic health issues which often limited his mobility, and when he was stuck inside one of the things he'd do was post long, branching stories to a forum his friends ran. I treasure those stories now that he's gone. (There was also a webcomic.)\n\nI try to remember that the social internet is still relatively new, weird, and unfinished, because that means *we're still deciding what it can be.* And regular people have as much of a share in that \"we\" as the massive corporations do. Hashtags on Twitter happened because users started using them before official adoption. [A03 basically made tags a turing complete language](https://www.mmmx.cloud/fan-is-a-tool-using-animal/).\n\nI admire when people can do that, just say \"[idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.](https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers)\"  [It's a foundational principle of the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/a-group-is-its-own-worst-enemy/). Without realizing it, I think I left that audacity in the land of websites, and fell in line with the social internet more than I wanted to.\n\nThere were two moments I can actually identify that woke me up to the idea that *I could have expectations* of social media and take some agency in how I use it. It reminded me that what we think of as social media is really just some ways of doing things on top of the basic fact that people can talk to each other through the internet. Basically that *it doesn't have to be this way.*\n\n### Awakening #1: Darius Kazemi's Run Your Own Social\n\nReading just the *headlines* of [this excellent guide](https://runyourown.social/) is enough to crack the shackles of Big Social from your mind. There is a direct line between me reading  *[You get to make the social rules and policies](https://runyourown.social/#you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies)* if you make your own social network and me starting up a private forum called Paddleboat for my friends at the beginning of the pandemic that became a loved and comfortable online space for some of us during those scary early days. When interest flagged below the $30-a-month-feels-ok-to-me level, we moved to Discord instead, called it Rollerblade, and now it's still going strong. It even got a shoutout in my friend [Ezra's newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies/archive/long-covid-studies-the-origin-story/).\n### Awakening #2: Ezra's favorite social network\n\nSpeaking of Ezra, five or six years ago, I was probably griping about Facebook, and Ezra said, offhand, that his favorite social network is just group texts. And that he had multiple ongoing ones with different themes. Shortly after that we started one with our friend Clare named, for obscure reasons, `Chubswombat` which uses the Tubthumper album art as an avatar, for obvious reasons. It is still going.\n\nI have always admired how remarkably good Ezra is at connecting with people online and with talking to people about his ideas in general. (He's recently been using his powers to push forward Long Covid action, despite Long Covid's efforts to stop him, and you should [subscribe to his newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies#subscribe-form) and call your local representatives.)\n\nThe wisdom of this statement helped get and keep me off Facebook at the start of lockdown and reminded me how effortless and fun it can be to \"post\" with friends. We paid for our phones and service, why do we need to see ads to talk to each other? Since then I have enjoyed group threads including but not limited to:\n\n- A yearslong round of [The RV Game](https://www.martenstuffer.com/anal-rvs)\n- The Castle of Friendship\n- All logistics for the DnD group I run, grouptext having defeated every other platform we attempted to use\n- Weird chips\n- Catsitting in my building\n- My niece's \"youtube channel\" which is just her making videos on her mom's phone and then her mom sending it to me and my wife and us \"liking\" and \"subscribing\"\n- Photos of the Kaiser Permanente building in Portland\n- Emoji notifications when one of two of my friends is peeing. (This started because one walked in on the other in the bathroom like a decade ago. Not sure how I got added.)\n- Videos a friend has been making with a wig she drags on a string like a pet\n\nMy favorite part of getting a smartphone was sending and getting pictures of works in progress with fellow painters. My favorite part of Instagram is seeing other painters' paintings and three group DMs I am in. _Maybe we don't actually need the rest of Instagram._ (**Maybe** the non-linkable, non-zoomable, non-text-copy-able _automatically disappearing_ portion of a closed surveillence advertising platform is *not* the ideal place to share logistical information about local grassroots cultural events but *what do I know.*)\n\n\n## What this means to me\n\nI think the values laid out in Run Your Own Social get pretty far towards a set of values for a social internet. And I think we're still pretty far from a world where it's easy to find platforms that embody them. I also think...we won't because... maybe... not? platforms? at all?\n\nMaybe the meta-value for whatever comes next is just this:\n\n## Social Networks Should Meet You Where You Already Are\n\nIf you try to make a new social network, the biggest obstacle is getting people to stop using the one where all their friends already are and use yours. So it can feel like TikTok or Instagram or Facebook are where people already are. This is true in a way. But the number of other people we can really connect with and keep track of is too small for big platforms to make money off our activity. So they have to train individuals to act like businesses or famous people. They teach us to talk like we're broadcasting while being told we're among friends. When we flee that pressure, we make themed chats, local groups, events, memes. That's where we actually are as *people* instead of *users*. \n\nThe platforms are the biggest, stinkiest bus stations imaginable. The scale of activity is thrilling, the access they provide has become important infrastructure, but the people that try to talk to the whole bus station at once are either hucksters, potentially violent, shills, or otherwise sketchy. We *avoid* those conversations and find small spaces where we can talk to each other. We are sharing a booth with some friends, or sitting on a bench with a few strangers, waiting to go to the same place. We want to talk to people, not platforms.\n\n\n## Our part in this\n\nI've never really articulated it to this level of detail, but some feral sense beneath the discomfort of having to go to the world's biggest stinkiest bus station just to share a booth with some friends and talk about paintings is how I got thinking about free-floating hashtags on a 15 mile day in Canyonlands (and possibly to distract from our inadequate water supply). My initial spec was very document-based, because documents were where I already was. (If you ever work with nonprofits or the government, you'll know that's where a lot of people still are.) I want a little Nim_and_Nik_Chat 8.0 magically integrated with this markdown document, and I want it to be easy for other people to have their version of that too. I love that as soon as I put this online and octothorpe it, Nik will get an email. I love that it will automatically show up in my list of essays on [a blog post I made on another website.](https://ideastore.dev/blog/why-tho/). I love that I don't know where else it will show up in the future.\n\nBut in the end it doesn't matter where you start -- the idea is that, wherever you already are, if you can't connect to your friends *and have a good conversation*, we'd like to make something that makes that possible. This is crucially different than \"wherever you are, you should be able to shout at the whole bus station at once.\" I also hope it will be crucially different than \"we just made another bus station with fewer people and weird rules.\" That will depend on how good Octothorpes is at letting people say \"idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.\""

      "There was a particularly strong thread that ran through most of my conversations at [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) this year. It was braided from questions (pleas?) like the following:\n\n- what's wrong with the internet now\n- can we make it not poisonous again\n- could we even make it fun again\n- what about all those sites we used to make for ouselves\n- how can we find the people and communities doing that now\n\nBefore the talks, this wasn't much of a surprise. I was there in large part to talk about these things! Nik and I had purposely busted ass to get [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es/) ready to share because XOXO seemed like the biggest gathering we could find of people who would get it. (Briefly, Octothorpes are hashtags and backlinks you can use on independent sites. You can read *a lot more* starting from [the guide we made for XOXO.](https://octothorp.es/xoxo2024.html)) I had just written essays called [We really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/) and  [We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-got-used-to-talking-to-the-internet-itself-instead-of-people-on-the-internet/) as a way of explaining why we were making Octothorpes. So this was on my mind.\n\nWe hoped to find a few people who were asking similar questions. I was *not* expecting that nearly everyone I talked to was likely to bring these questions up *first*. And when they seemed to form a powerful, unifying chain of critique and inquiry and hope through the main talks... I think I actually pumped my fist in the air a few times.\n\n\n## Tracing the thread\n\nSome points on the line, in chronological order:\n\n*note: most of these quotes are from memory. Once the recordings of the talks are posted I'll link to them and correct anything here. Feel free to correct me if you have notes.*\n\n[Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com/) says \"**Indie is just an economic descriptor**\" in his funny, insightful talk about the highs and lows of trying to make it building independent projects and communities on the internet, in part as a followup to his 2014 talk \"[How I Won The Lottery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw)\" This was to say that it's a way of existing in the market, rather than a coherent aesthetic or a value system, and it can be liberating or fuck you up in equal measures.\n\nSomeone? says something to the effect \"**We used to do weird things on the internet and then at some point it started doing weird things to us?**” Interestingly, when I tried to clarify who said this on the XOXO slack, it was clear that this could be considered one of the main themes of the festival. Someone else asked Andy Baio, one of the organizers, if this was on purpose. He responded that, while he had themes in mind when inviting speakers, they were ultimately in control of their own talks. He didn't even see the talks before they presented live, so this solid theme we felt mostly came together organically.\n\nDefinitely [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/) asked the room to **remember the time they felt embodied excitement, like in the pit of their stomach, about making something on the internet**. Her example was building her user profile page (called a lookup) on Neopets. She challenged us to find that feeling again with what we do now. The crowd was stoked.\n\n[Erin Kissane](https://erinkissane.com/), with great generosity and attention, told her story of gathering countless friends and strangers via the internet to process early COVID data. How it became the foundation for whatever public understanding we had of the pandemic, and what that community of purpose meant to her. This structured her nuanced critique of the current state of the internet. She implored us not to take a \"dark forest\" approach in leaving the sites of the current online toxicity. Both so these networks of care and shared concern could still form in public, and so that there was somewhere for those who come next to go. Instead, she gave us the rallying cry **Fix the fucking networks.** It's a line that I know many people in the last week or so have written down in their own accounts and web logs.\n\n[Ed Yong's](https://edyong.me/) moving, personal talk brought it home about both what one could do with the internet and what it could do to you. It was so open-hearted and immediate and personal that I don't really feel like I can or should try to summarize it here, only to say that when I do post the video you should definitely watch it all. In it, he said something along the lines that **we'll look back on the era where we put our random thoughts online for milions of strangers to read like we look back on when we built houses with asbestos.** This was greeted with ripples of laughter and then applause, filtered through I believe both relief and regret.\n\nOur through-line so far, paraphrased:\n\n- Indie just means out there on your own. And that can be pretty hard.\n- We used to do weird things on the internet, and now it does weird things to us.\n- Try to remember when making things on the internet felt creative and exciting.\n- We need to fix the fucking networks if we want to hang on to that feeling, and be safe out there on our own, while still being able to find each other.\n- Massive social media feeds are acute *and* chronic health hazards.\n\nSo, the way people talked about \"being on the internet\" at the last XOXO, in 2019, felt, uhh, *different* than this. This felt like a \"Frogs that jumped out of the pot[^1]\" conference. A \"How do we deal with the fact that society and most of our livlihoods have oriented themselves to this boiling pot of water that towers over our every waking moment while all we want to do is hop around and catch flies?\"\n## Next -- the IndieWeb becomes or remains discourse\n\nWhile mulling this all over in the last week, I came across some posts, on independent blogs, that seemed to be part of this zeitgeist for the open internet. They were both for small and personal websites and critical of some of the largest current projects working towards independent and non-commercial internet spaces, the IndieWeb and Fediverse movements.\n\nRoughly in order that I read them:\n\n- [Yelling at Clouds](https://manuelmoreale.com/yelling-at-the-web-clouds) by Manuel Morale\n- [IndieWeb's 3 Body Problem](https://so1o.xyz/blog/3-body-problem) by Solo\n- [Smaller](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/smaller/) by Simone Silvestroni\n- [Has the IndieWeb become Irrelevant](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html) by Matthew Graybosch\n- [The Social Web](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-social-web) by Manuel Morale\n\nAnd responses from the IndieWeb community:\n- [Has the IndieWeb become discourse again?](https://martymcgui.re/2024/08/29/141602/) by Marty McGuire\n- [Ownership, connection, and control](https://json.blog/2024/08/29/ownership-connection-and.html) by Jason Becker\n\n\nA lot of it is inside-baseball for a small community, and I don't even think it registers on the internet drama scale. I agree with a many of the specific points from the critical side, enough that I'm already building something that I think aligns with many of them, but I also agree with much of the responses from the IndieWeb community, who are all, in all of my experience, friendly, welcoming, and open minded people. If this is stuff you already care about, I do encourage you to read all these posts. But, with the thread from XOXO running through my thoughts, here's a summary of what I thought was most compelling from these posts.\n\n- If you want to be an individual who writes stuff on a website who talks to other individuals about it, email, a webpage, and RSS do really well for that. You might not need more than that.\n- We should critically assess the benefits of integration between \"websites\" and \"platforms\"\n- The Fediverse largely reproduces patterns designed by corporate social media, just with a better ownership model. Let's critically assess those patterns.\n- However accessible non-commercial internet authorship tools are trying to be, a lot of people -- perhaps most -- still find the bar too high.\n- No one can agree on what \"IndieWeb\" or \"indie web\" really means\n- We're even having a hard time agreeing what \"the social web\" means\n\nHere's what stuck out to me about the *context* in which these posts are being discussed:\n\n- These posts are all in conversation, almost all of them from the last few weeks, on static, self-made websites, and most of the authors insist on email as the main channel of response.\n- People are having substantive conversations about a topic that matters to them, and being pretty articulate, nuanced, and respectful about it even when they're disagreeing. \n- The posts have reached people outside of the author's immediate community without the authors promoting them on any platforms\n\n\nReading this conversation felt like hearing from frogs that got out of the pot before it got warm. I think, in general, those are good people to listen to in whatever context you encounter them. But...\n\nIt is very easy to go, fuck yeah, out with the new, in with the old, let's make the internet sane and quiet and small. But... \n\nIt's very hard to balance that with Erin Kissane's call to action. As she said in her talk, she and her army of volunteers should never have had to step in to do the work we expect our governments to do in a pandemic. But now we have the tools for citizens to self-organize *en masse* about issues they care about, so we should think very critically about dismantling them before the next pandemic. How do we balance these concerns?\n\n\n## The Active Web\n\nHere I am participating in discourse, in relatively real-time. How did I get into it? I saw a [post by Sarah Joy on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sarajw/113035847169727351) that linked to a post that linked to this. So a combination of the convenience of a social feed, and the small web's call to browse.\n\nThe double edged sword of convenience is that it's accessible, but it's also exploitable. In America, a \"convenience\" store is conveniently located, but it's also full of addictive substances. Nothing hates inconvenience more than addiction.\n\nSo maybe \"passive\" is a better watchword for what we're trying to change about the internet. After all, Erin Kissane wasn't talking about the importance of large networks of *passive* users consuming content. I think she was talking about the importance of maintaining a low bar for *engagement,* since the network she so valued was one of the most engaged collections of people on the internet ever. Also, I am not and have never been close to marketing, so I mean engagement as, like, you know, *engaging* with shit you care about. Not whatever else it ends up meaning.\n\nMastodon made it *convenient* for me to find this set of articles, but I had to actively engage with it to appreciate it.\n\nJason Becker says: \n\n *I am never going to get all of the people I’m connected to online to go back to using RSS. And I’m not going to get them to bookmark my webpage and visit it multiple times a day. They have places they consistently read feeds.*\n\n\nI don't think that's entirely true. I mean, no, not everyone. [Maybe not every post is for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2vejhdm8lo&t=49s) But I only read his post because I checked, for the third time, the website of a guy who checked Jason's website. Maybe no one's going to find and check your website without a reason, but I'm going to click through if I actually care about it, or if the link looks interesting. This is called *browsing* and I miss it.\n\nI feel like all these conversations and calls to action I hear have this in common; they're calling for an active and critical engagement with the internet -- what we put on it, how we build it, and how we use it to connect with other people. For some people that means writing your own CMS from scratch and federating all your posts to multiple services. For others it might mean making a mutual aid Facebook group. Or maybe just starting a text thread with friends. \n\nThere's a sort of \"cat's out of the bag, what comes next?\" vibe to a lot of these conversations. I definitely don't have the answer, but I've really appreciated the questions and challenges posed by all the sources I've posted here. This is what I'm hearing:\n\n- We want to be able to connect, broadly\n- We want a humane speed.\n- We don't just want moderation, we want a kind of internet that *can be moderated.* We might just want moderate internet.\n- We have been convinced that you can't scale if you ask people to *do something* to get to content, rather than just lining up to receive it.\n- We have been convinced that stuff has to scale.\n\n \nErin Kissane is challenging us to do something that can empower mass numbers of people without having to *harvest* mass numbers of people. That's definitely tricky.\n\nBut if this is where the conversation is at, I'm excited to see what comes next and will try hard to contribute meaningfully to it.\n\nThank you XOXO for making this conversation feel vital, spirited, and friendly.\n\nps OMG I almost forgot. One of the great things that came out of this zeitgeist already was Molly White putting out a call for personal blogs in the afterglow of the festival on the XOXO slack and getting [this treasure trove](https://gist.github.com/molly/e5003cfed284baf075c01e9470c089bc) back. That's your present for getting this far. ❌🅾️❌🅾️\n\n[^1]: In likening the experience of using the internet in the 21st century to frogs in a pot of boiling water, I should point out that frogs, and all other creatures with enough sense not to invent social media, actually do jump out.

      "Part of me wants to talk about how fun the internet was when it was *just* websites. But we barely had tags then, let alone hashtags. Much like the \"Y2K Garage Sale\" that happened down the street from me, any nostalgia I have for that time is selective memory indelibly colored by all the work that we did to improve things since the early 2000s. I remember enjoying *reading* the internet much more back then, but *writing* it felt much worse.\n\nIt might be snappier to say that this project came out of \"a love for the way the web used to be\" or something like that, but that's not quite it. People are making [beautiful](https://www.spencerchang.me/window/), [compelling](https://pearsproject.org/) [work](https://oral.pub/) on the internet maybe [more than ever](https://diagram.website/). I feel like I've found some of my favorite projects *this year.* *So why does using internet feel like being trapped in a garbage dump most of the time??*\n\nTrying to answer this question is *definitely* part of what led to Octothorpes, if indirectly.\n\nBesides the obvious answers, primary among them that huge monopolies have tried very hard to make it this way, I have two theories that have been driving me.\n\n## First Theory: Our expectations of the internet have been colonized\n\nWhen I think of the experience of reading the internet that I miss, I realize it had a lot in common with reading zines, which were also a much bigger part of my life then. A certain lack of professionalism in content *and* delivery was to be expected. There were some memes, but most sites had a distinct personal voice, and it was also a *reading* experience more than it was a *scrolling* experience. \n\nThe high-water-mark for me was having a daily web-comic reading ritual. I could have subscribed to their RSS feeds, but I had a [sequence](https://www.dieselsweeties.com/) [I](https://www.wigucomics.com/oc/index.php?comic=1538) [liked](https://scarygoround.com/index.html) [to](http://drmcninja.com) [read](https://achewood.com/) them in and I could go from one to the next by clicking the \"other good comics\" links in their footers. I'm just now realizing that maybe the best part of this ritual was that after it, I would *leave my computer and go do other things for the rest of the day.* 🤔\n\nAfter Web 1.0, we drifted away from the idea that you could usually read *all* or most of something you liked on the internet. When you did, sometimes it was hard to find more. Crucially you often had to *look for* the good stuff -- it wasn't just piped into your brain endlessly. Recommendations came from people, both friends or the authors of the material you were reading. All of this became an anathema when we shifted gears up to Web 2.0 on the infobahn.\n\nThe best articulation of that shift that I've read is [The Garden and the Stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). A garden is something you return to, either to tend or enjoy, while a stream rushes by forever. This is [one of](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406) the originating points of the concept of \"[digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)\"  and I was among the people moved by it to make one. In fact I went deeper to turn it into a [memex](https://mmmx.cloud) of sorts.\n\nThere are so may things we used to assume about putting things on the internet that quietly slipped away in the shift from the garden to the stream. This list can also be called \"Things That Are Not True About Instagram.\" Some of these things are true about some of the big sites, less so when you use their app, but I wonder for how long.\n\n## Things we assumed about the internet during Web 1.0\n\n- If you want to put some thing on the internet, you put them on websites\n- You have to Go Online to see websites.\n- This means you can Go Offline\n- Web pages had URLs\n- Web pages loaded, and then you had a web page\n- \"Having\" a website means, mostly, owning a website and the things on it\n- You can open larger versions of scaled images\n- If you post something, it's not going to disapper on its own unless you delete it\n- You can copy text\n- You can click on all links\n- You can download things you want to save\n- Websites don't make your phone ding or vibrate\n- No one is remotely monitoring your browsing activity\n- You don't scroll to discover things, you browse or \"surf\"\n- Recommendations come from people\n- Scrolling ends\n\nI miss all of these. However, these things I don't miss:\n\n- Posting takes significant effort, money, and special knowledge\n- Email or messy comment sections are the only way to connect with people posting stuff you liked\n- Accessibility was nonexistent\n- Links rot and standards change quickly\n- Other than StumbleUpon, most connections are manually maintained (webrings, link lists, blogrolls)\n- A lot of people didn't feel welcome or like they could find people to connect with\n\nAnd of course, some of these are often still the case.\n\nThis isn't a unique -- or complete -- list of values for an open internet. A lot of people are thinking about this. The [Manifesto for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/) is a great start towards that list of values, and almost everything else I'd link to is in their \"further reading\" or \"references\" section. \n\nMy list is just what I try to remind myself about the discomfort I feel with the way it feels to post on the Internet of Today. That it's not inevitable or necessary to give up the things on the first list to change the things on the second. I think we've just been upsold and enshittified into living on processed [slop](https://www.garbageday.email/p/slop-void) when we actually have better tools than ever to go out and garden for ourselves. \n\nSo that's one reason we're building Octothorpes -- to make it easier to have an internet like the first list without the stuff on the second list.\n\nPart two: <a class='internal-link' href='/we-got-used-to-talking-to-the-internet-itself-instead-of-people-on-the-internet/'>We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet</a>"

All the sources cited in <a class='internal-link' href='/the-conceptual-labor-book/'>The Conceptual Labor Book</a>\n\n**Real Things:** <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/pikas-place'>Pika's Place</a>. <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Corby's Collages  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>.\n\n**Ghost Things:** <a class='internal-link' href='/the-mole-diagram/'>The Mole Diagram</a>. <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  The Three Kinds of Things  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>. <a class='internal-link' href='/urs/'>Urs</a>.\n\n\nThis is definitely somewhat of a departure from the original, far more romantic structure, but it's a version I've worked with in my mind for a long time now.\n\n#### Things\n\nThings are more commodity-like, atoms of experience, pretty readily transmitted. The remembering is in the collecting of them. These seem to be pretty well-served by existing tools, analog or digital, and more in line with traditional means of archiving.\n\n#### Real Things\n\nReal Things don't quite exist without the rememberer's touch, without some interpretation. Possibly they require a production step -- they must be gone out and got, encountered before they can be collected.\n\n#### Ghost Things\n\nGhost Things are both the most real and unreal of things. I think they're a bit like the back of your head -- you need a mirror to see them and they never look quite right in the reflection, but without them your brain would fall out.\n\nI don't feel that confident in any other description of them yet, so I'm gonna keep trying to use this as a mirror and see if that gets us anywhere."

      "Buckmanite, or Buckman Slate, is a metamorphic substance endemic to many urban environments, but first identified in the Buckman neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It is a composite material formed when plastic municipal containers undergo rapid exothermic reactions, deforming to bond with the surrounding environment. These reactions are most often triggered by human intervention, both accidental and intentional, but theoretically could be triggered by natural phenomena such as lightning or incidental lensing of sunlight through nearby mirrors or windows during a heatwave. \n\n![A Typical depost of Buckmanite](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Deposit Typical.jpeg)\n\nBuckmanite usually ranges from dark to light blue in appearance, while green, brown, and even yellow varieties have been identified. When fully formed, Buckmanite is usually found in wide, pool-like deposits characterized by an irregular, layered surface, mechanically bonded to the ground substrate. Buckmanite is unusual in its ability to form novel cement-like structures and fuse with existing cement or composite materials.\n\n### Buckmanite as cement matrix\n\nMany factors influence the composition of Buckmanite. The time of year, time of day, microclimate, and even the side of the street on which Buckmanite forms can dictate the internal structure of the material. Substances within and without the original form of the container will become suspended in the transformed material. These include leaves, inorganic refuse, and grains of sidewalk or asphalt up to 1cm across. \n\n### Buckmanite as cement ingredient\n\nSignificant deposits can be easily removed with common hand tools, but thinner layers may integrate so fully into their environment as to become a permanent feature. Pre-transformation, the polymer components of Buckmanite are fully mobile in relation to the cement surfaces of its typical environment. The energetic process of its formation bonds the material to its hyperlocal environment. In this way the material represents a transition from container to surface.\n\n![Buckmanite in the process of merging with its envirionment](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Typical Substrate Partial Formation Close View.jpeg)\n\n\nEven partial formation of Buckmanite is enough to cause an ontological metamorphosis of its source materials. Here, a container has lost its internality and has become refuse in need of containing.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite Disposal.jpeg)\n\n### Exotic components\n\nBuckmanite is defined by a process and location as much as it is by pure material composition. Many different possible structures and appearances of Buckmanite have been theorized. Pictured here is a dramatic example of the incomplete formation of Buckmanite from an atypical source. Note that the original structure was not able to sustain an exothermic reaction long enough to fully transform.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite%20-%20Atypical%20Substrate%20%20Partial%20Formation.jpeg)\n\n### Environmental Indicator\n\nWhile the physical components of Buckmanite are common, its formation most typically occurs within specific sociological conditions. These conditions can be grouped as **Ignition Conditions** and **Formation Conditions.**\n\n## Ignition conditions\n\nA primary condition seems to be the intersection of consistent on-street activity within residential or mixed-use neighborhoods. The housed population and local businesses are responsible for the continued presence of refuse containers, and enough range of on-street activity will provide an ongoing presence of unsanctioned interactions (ie any interaction not within the [use permitted by the city](https://www.portland.gov/bps/garbage-recycling/garbage-recycling-and-compost-rules-and-regulations) or private owners of the containers). The combination, will, in select circumstances, provide the conditions required to ignite the material. \n\nFolk theories tend to assign responsibility to unhoused or otherwise indigent actors, but ample field observations contradict this theory. The crucial criteria here is *activity on the street.* Whether that activity comes from a housed or unhoused population is not relevant. Whether or not formation conditions exist, ignition conditions are frequently met by affluent residents of or visitors to neighborhood with a high density of alcohol-serving establishments or proximity to major sporting arenas. The common misconception that ignition conditions are necessarily intentional has been repeatedly disproven. In fact, accidental ignition is perhaps even more common than intentional.\n\n## Formation conditions\n\nPerhaps as part of some form of ecological homeostasis, the conditions required for Buckmanite formation only exist in regions with inorganic substrates and little vegetation. Were refuse containers to be commonly found in rural or forested areas, ignition would likely cause a wildfire. Buckmanite exists in a space between controlled and wild environments. A refuse container completely destroyed by a wildfire is not recognizable as Buckmanite, just as a simple garbage fire that fails to bond with its neighborhood also fails to qualify as this unique substance.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nMuch like other modern minerals such as [Fordite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordite), Buckmanite is a material formed a specific time and place, reflecting the cultural conditions of its site. \n\n## Gallery\n\nPlease enjoy this gallery of <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/buckmanite/'>Buckmanite Samples</a>\n\n\n"

It had been a long, long journey to get to our wedding, spanning multiple road trips and the first two years of the pandemic. It was very late on the night of our wedding, and we were having an emotional connection with our friend Drew, who had d.j.’d for us. I dug around in Martha’s bag to give him more money, and found this bottle cap. It was from the trip to Africa Martha took right after we first met, one of two she’d take that year, which made her seem very worldly and well-traveled to me. The Andes mint wrapper crammed in the back was unmistakably from the bottomless bowl of free Andes mints at the Roadside Attraction bar in our old neighborhood in Portland, which we hadn’t been to for years because of the Pandemic and moving way. Indellible artifacts from two different, distinct parts of our lives, both seemingly a million years gone, plinking to the floor in a moment that very concretely felt like the point on which our lives were pivoting to become something new.</p>\n",

      "![Two red paintings](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-060323-5.jpeg)\n\nAmy is a friend of me and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>, and a treasure of Portland's painting scene. Martha's been working at Nationale since we moved back, so we were both really stoked when Amy had a solo show there. Martha even had the pleasure of writing her exhibition statement.\n\nThe exhibition was a real knockout, especially if you've been following Amy's work for a while. Some of the pieces really felt like they'd been slowly growing for a long time, like the thickets of abundance they depicted. It felt a little like coming back to a familiar patch of forest or a trail after a couple seasons of growth. It's the place you remember, but you keep noticing evidence of the unseen force that animates it.\n\n[Here's the official documentation from Nationale](https://www.nationale.us/amy-bay-they-always-have-and-still-do-2023)\n\nAmy also gave a wonderful talk towards the end of the run of the show. She has a way of talking about her practice and the work of painting in general that is really refreshing and comfortable. It feels like she has done the work, loves the work, and has a healthy respect for the difficulty of it. And she's got the same sort of calm clarity of observation in how she talks about painting that she has in her visual depictions. So it was a good talk overall, but it was extra satisfying to hear her confirm and expand on some of the vibes I picked up. She and May (owner of Nationale) joked about the arc of changes for certain paintings between studio visits, and ended up pointing out some specific formal qualities that were new in this show.\n\n![Amy Speaking at the show](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-070623.jpeg)\nThat was something really satisfying that reminds me what's valuable about close looking or listening to artists talk about their work or good criticism or even just doing a little more research than swiping through images on Instagram. Like, that new-growth feeling I had was very present but hard to describe -- remarkable but ineffable. And I suppose I could have sat down with documentation of Amy's previous work and done some degree of comparative cataloguing and come up with some formal qualities that describe the differences. But that's not how we usually engage with paintings, and even when people have paid me to do that in writing it can take an unwieldy amount of time to get anywhere with it.\n\nBut when Amy was like \"yeah this might be the first painting of mine with a horizon line\" or pointed out that there's a semi-intentional diptych in the show, or talked at length about the mysterious insistence of the dark flower in the center of one of the most striking pieces -- those are some of those really rewarding moments of taking art seriously. I don't need everything noticeable to be explainable, but when you hear someone articulate the thing you noticed, that you keep thinking about but not in words, it's like this bridge between parts of your brain that I feel like we're generally discouraged from connecting. \n\n::::\n\nI thought I was going to write about the surfaces of these paintings more, but maybe I'll do that another time. (Which makes me think of the thesis of <a class='internal-link' href='/patterns-of-intention/'>Patterns of Intention</a>.) Amy does really cool stuff with cold wax medium, scumbling, and very thin washes of color that makes these rich surfaces that feel organic while remaining very much just paint. \n\n\n\ncheck out the gallery here: <a class='internal-link' href='/gallery/they-always-have-and-still-do/'>They Always Have and Still Do</a>"

      "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The <a class='internal-link' href='/development-log/'>Development Log</a> has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend <a class='internal-link' href='/ryan/'>Ryan</a>, who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least <a class='internal-link' href='/evan/'>one friend</a> into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Digital Gardens  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> and <a class='internal-link' href='/tag/cozyweb/'>cozyweb</a>.\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  astronomy-picture-of-the-day  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  public-domain-review  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  the-morning-news  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n* and <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a>'s excellent <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span>\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the <span title='There is no note that matches this link.' class='invalid-link'>  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>[[</span>  bookmarks  <span class='invalid-link-brackets'>]]</span></span> bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show <a class='internal-link' href='/martha/'>Martha</a> a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden).

      "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n"
