    "raw_markdown": "This is a post following up a story I posted *on* Instagram volunteering to help anyone interested to get *off* Instagram and onto something more open, with the hopes we could get a little crew together to seed a small network that could be fun enough to keep using. Because of a) everything and b) Meta's recent rollback of [moderation and/or attempt to cut its workforce in the shittiest way possible](https://bsky.app/profile/utopia-defer.red/post/3lfpzprwaic2v),  it seems like this is another moment where people are looking around for options. A few people I know are planning to leave the platform right now, so I want this to serve as a reference for them and anyone else interested the next time ripples of dissatsifaction spread across the platform.\n\n## The Modest Goal\n\nFive of us start using a new platform and each convince one friend to do the same.\n\nIf we did that, I bet we'd have a pleasant little crew on a chiller platform, which could make it worth checking regularly, and might even entice more friends to join. \"QUOTE\"\n\nI willingly use Instagram for two things: 1) brain-rotting meme garbage 2) seeing paintings and photos from friends and artists I admire. I very unwillingly use it to learn crucial information about art shows and life events that people post to temporary, non-zoomable posts on one of the worst interfaces on earth.\n\nInstagram and other big platforms will always have our back on #1, but I think we can achieve #2 with a little bit of effort. \n\nGive this a read, and definitely feel free to ask me any questions you have, and please share with friends!\n\n## One excellent but unrealistic option\n\nJust blog! Blogging is great, and easy, and you can read blogs via RSS. You already use RSS if you listen to Podcasts. RSS readers are really, really great because you get to build your own feed(s) of content and there are no ads. We are in a renaissance of blogs, and I will personally sit down with you and set you up on the blog you want and give you the tools to make a network of friends together.\n\n...but I know that this is _not_ the same experience of opening up an app that makes it easy to quickly post something, so here are:\n\n## Two Good, Visually-Focused Options\n\nMy personal suggestion is that you either use  [Are.na](https://www.are.na/) or [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), or. These are two very different options, and neither one is perfect. Everything here is very much my personal opinion, written for friends. \n\n### [Are.na](https://www.are.na/)\n\nArena is sort of its own beast, but it's very focused on visual posts. It's both a way to share content and save it for yourself. You could think of it as a Pinterest for hip contemporary artists and designers who go to the kind of cafes that I'm typing this in. I have an Are.na account, but rarely use it. However, knowing almost no one on there, I still find really good stuff whenever I log in.\n\nPros: \n- Excellent content\n - lots of interesting accounts, like [Cari](https://cari.institute/)\n - has an app\n - focused on curation by humans instead of algorithms\n - independently run\n\nCons:\n- Limited free version, then $7 a month\n- In my opinion, an unnecessarily confusing UI and structure\n- Private, closed platform\n\n## Pixelfed\n\nPixelfed is basically Instagram on the Fediverse. [It's getting some traction right now, and Instagram doesn't like that.](https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/) The [Fediverse](https://buffer.com/resources/fediverse-beginners-guide/) is a bunch of independently operated servers, run usually by people not corporations, that can all talk to each other using an open source protocol that is also not owned by a corporation. They're *federated* rather than centralized, hence \"Fediverse.\" Here's my [Mastodon account](https://xoxo.zone/@nim), which is like Twitter, but federated.  Being \"on the Fediverse\" means that anything using the protocol can talk to each other --  Mastodon, which looks like Twitter, can connect to Pixelfed, which looks like Instagram. It's a little confusing, but it means you can pick from lots of apps and servers and styles of using the fediverse, and still follow people using different things. It's pretty cool once you get used to it.\n\n\nThreads (mostly) works on the Fediverse, so if you have people posting on Threads you want to follow, you can *probably* follow them from your own Pixelfed account.\n\nPros:\n- Free\n- Federated, so the network might grow\n- Very instagrammy\n- There are ways to cross-post to different services\n\nCons:\n- kinda confusing to set up\n- the cross-post methods can be *very* nerdy and technical\n- the Fediverse can seem pretty empty and geeky if you don't have a lot of friends there\n\n\n> ### Why not [Cara?](https://cara.app/explore) \n> I'm not confident in its stability. There's a lot to love there, and the people working on it (I've met some) seem to be really great, but it's currently a volunteer project, and we've had some heartbreaking failures of wonderful projects (like Cohost) in the independent web space, so I'm concerned by their lack of runway.\n\n## A Secret Third Thing\n\nSome disappointing shit went down with Micro.blog since I posted this, so rescinding this recommendation for now. If the service was as distributed as the underlying technology, maybe there'd be another, better managed server to join. Hazards of single platforms are still there even if the code's open.\n\n~~[Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/about/pricing) is a way to blog on the Fediverse, so it does all the stuff up there and more. I honestly don't know if this will be easier or harder to get so I put it last. It's like a combination of Twitter and blogging, but you can follow or be followed by people on Threads or Mastodon or Pixelfed and even automatically crosspost to those or Bluesky.~~\n\n~~Pros:~~\n- ~~post in one place, see and be seen on different platforms~~\n- ~~custom domain if you want it~~\n- ~~kinda weird?~~\n\n~~Cons:~~\n- ~~$1-10 a month~~\n- ~~Interface is a little limited and underdeveloped at times~~\n- ~~possibly hard to understand?~~\n---\n\n## Other options\n\n- BlueSky! It feels more and more like Twitter, which I'm not sure is great, but [I'm on there.](https://bsky.app/profile/niiiiim.bsky.social) It's also technically Federated, but in a much, much earlier stage of doing that kind of thing. [Mark Ruffalo is trying to help.](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/14/free_our_feeds_decentralized_social_media/)\n- Tumblr. It's still there. [I'm on there](https://www.tumblr.com/flarmbt), kind of. It's a closed platform, but less... terrible? Pretty sure the owner of Wordpress will destroy it eventually, though.\n\n## Some background on me and why I think small steps like these are important\n\nThis section is mostly for anyone who might have found this who doesn't already know me.\n\nI'm not an open-source purist, but I guess I'm  pretty high on the nerd scale compared to average. (Maybe half of this site is written in markdown on a 12-year-old Thinkpad running Peppermint Linux, and the rest is on my M1 Macbook.) I build a lot of small sites, and have run a few small social networks for friends, including a self-hosted forum and a Discord, and have run or participated in small-to-medium sized research, critique, and art groups IRL. I've also been doing a lot of work in the small / open web space this year because of [Octothorpes](https://ideastore.dev/blog/octothorpes-public-beta/), and I got very, very lucky [to go to the last XOXO festival](https://www.mmmx.cloud/after-xoxo) where \"how can we fix the fucking networks\" was the hot topic. I highly, *highly* recommend [reading / watching Erin Kissane's](https://erinkissane.com/xoxo) talk she gave at XOXO. \n\nMuch like Erin says in her talk, I'm not suggesting we can escape the network of friends and resources that are, for the moment, captured by closed platforms like Instagram just by using \"better technology.\" But the more I go looking for healthy alternatives, the more there are to find. Watching Mastodon before and after the big Twitter exodus was instructive. It's not earthshaking, but better networks are possible. \n\nMy from-the-heart advice is start a stinkin blog and use Octothorpes so my RSS reader will fill up with joy every day, but, well, baby steps.\n\n",

Within a week, someone had hung up a feeder.\n\n![A photo of a mother hummingbird in her nest](/assets/hummingbirds/ms-paddleboat.jpg) \n\nThen one day, in her place we saw two dopey beaks poking out from a tiny mass of pinfeathers and sleepiness.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1aty-YjqDM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<br>\n\nMs. Paddleboat, as we had named her, soon hatched two grundy lil dorkuses that we named Alfredo and Paddleboat.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat01.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat02.jpg) \n\nThey were skeptical of us from the start.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat03.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat04.jpg)\n\nWe were concerned when Ms. Paddleboat stopped coming back to the nest. It was late February and we got some pretty cold weather. The first and most prominent result of even a little googling was -- _don't_ worry and ***don't touch them***! Mother hummingbirds usually leave the nest as soon as they can, returning only to feed their little dorkuses. This is so they don't lead predators back to the nest -- which is pretty smart considering they're the size of a thimble.\n\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat05.jpg) \n\nThey got fat real quick. Alfredo got fatter faster.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat06.jpg) \n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat07.jpg) \n\nWe were sad when they all flew away, but we remained hopeful that we would see them again. See, we had also learned that we should leave the nest in place, as they often return to the same nest year after year. And this year that's exactly what happened! Ms. Paddleboat came back and had another birb child. Our theory was that he was planning on getting so fat there wouldn't be room for a sibling in the nest.\n\n![A photo of baby hummingbirds in the nest](/assets/hummingbirds/paddleboat08.jpg) \n\nWe named him Butter Crumpet.\n",

    "raw_markdown": "Something incredible has happened in the short two weeks since I posted about the hummingbird family that lives in our courtyard, [[The Paddleboat Family.]]\n\nSee, a tiny, seemingly unfinished nest had been sitting in one of the trees closest to the entrance to the courtyard for as long as the Paddleboats had lived there, and we assumed that it was an abandoned first try. Their nest is deeper and carefully maintained -- Ms. Paddleboat clearly shored it up when she returned to it this year.\n\nMartha and I were practicing proper social distancing as I reluctantly skipped my usual Saturday morning Taiji class. It was a highlight of stuck-at-home time: we sat by the sunny window with the two most recent New Yorkers, and some extra-good coffee (Thanks [Saebom](https://saebomyang.com/) for the vastly improved pourover technique.). To further set the scene, we were  listening to [ambient music about Tea](https://open.spotify.com/album/1hAcu6EjmoTdRd6E526HzM?si=k3kaS143S3mIhQgYbGJ0ig) that I learned about via a [Twitter friend](https://twitter.com/elisabethnicula) who has very good bird content *and* a [Jekyll blog](https://abjectsubli.me/). When I explained all this to Martha she referred to the whole situation as \"peak Ním.\"\n\nSuddenly this peaceful domestic scene was interrupted by a \"thwack\" on the window. I was instantly alarmed -- it sounded roughly hummingbird-sized!\n\nHowever, when we peered out the window we were greeted not by tiny carnage but by Martha's bff and her husband -- Kirsty and Joe! They were on a socially-distant visit!\n\n![Kirsty and Joe standing in the courtyard. Joe is standing on one foot and holding a beer and Kirsty is smiling.](/assets/notes/kirsty-joe.jpg) \n\nWe had a lovely time talking to them. Then Kirsty said \"Did you see the hummingbird's nest!\"\n\nAnd we were all like \"Yeah, duh, we've _blogged_ about them.\"\n\nBut no! She didn't mean the Paddleboats' nest -- she meant the _other_ nest. It was not abandoned at all, and atop it sat another mother hummingbird! Smaller and with green iridescent feathers -- definitely not one of the Paddleboats!\n\nKirsty got a picture with her phone:\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun01.jpg) \n\nWe couldn't believe it! (Also this picture is sideways but it's kinda better that way.)\n\nLater we went out with my telephoto lens and got a few closeups to confirm she wasn't a Paddleboat.\n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun02.jpg) \n\n![Photo of a small hummingbird on a nest](/assets/hummingbirds/bao-bun03.jpg) \n\nShe seems to be doing very well out there. She's on her nest almost every time we leave the house (only for socially-distant walks) and rides out the weirdly high winds we've had recently with unruffled grace.\n\nWe named her Ms. Bao Bun. Because she is a little afternoon treat.\n\nHere is a bonus picture of [[Martha]] with a Bao.\n\n![Martha eats a doughy bun in shop in Chinatown in New York City](/assets/notes/martha-bao.jpg) ",

[The Public Interest Tech Webring](https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/)?\n\nIt's moments like these that remind me that maybe my first thought when I find little patches of thriving native plants in the corners of Online monoculture shouldn't be \"how long until this disappears?\" and instead just enjoy the clicking.\n\nLike, ok I just went back to those links turns out I'm looking at the blog of one of the bigger proponents of modern [webrings](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/)!\n\nThis is like the time I started writing about why I was making a digital garden and ended up discovering the gemini protocol >> [[How This Memex Started]]\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "I had a really vivid dream last night involving my late friend Corby. Since he passed away in 2018, he's shown up in my dreams a few times, but as far as I remember he was alive in those dreams. In this dream he was a ghost, and he knew it and I knew it.\n\nCorby ran his family's bookstore, [[Dawn Treader Books]]. It's still going strong under really great new management. I was just in there last month on my last visit to Michigan for Pete's wedding. So I think the version I was working with in my dream was pretty current.\n\nI don't know how I found myself there, but I was having a hard time finding what I was looking for. That happened the last time I was there, but I know that feeling comes from the fact that for two decades of my life, I'd see Corby when I walked in and that still feels like how it should be. I left, but then realized I had left my 90's-style cellphone there. When I walked back in, a huge group of students in white shirts was collecting on the landing of the stairs at the entrance. With dream logic, the more there were, the bigger the landing got. I asked the person working the counter what was going on and they said that they were from a class at the art college very similar to the one that [[Martha]] is teaching right now, and that in a minute their professor would get there and they'd teach their class in the store. It felt strange and new and like I didn't belong.\n\nWhile I stood there thinking, Corby just walked up, writing either a price or a duplicate card for the paperback he had in his hand. He looked like he did when he was in better health. Unlike other dreams, I was shocked to see him. He said something like \"Surprised to see me?\" In other dreams, it made sense at first to see him, and the realization that he was gone only set in later, or after I woke up. But this dream mostly felt like it would to suddenly see a younger Corby standing there in real life. I put it together and said \"They can't see you, can they?\" He shook his head and pointed towards the back of the store. \n\nI threaded my way through the students and followed him while we walked through the rows of books. I told him how good it was to see him, and asked what it was like to be dead. I don't think I asked what it was like to be a ghost -- I think we understood a difference between those things in the dream. Corby was dead, but that was something he could experience, and he was letting me see him.\n\nHe thought for a moment. Taking a beat to think real hard before talking was a classic Corby gesture. He was always much more taciturn than me, which was almost unfairly charming when it combined with his excellent sense of humor. \"Ok it's like this,\" he said. \"When you were in Glasgow\" -- here he pronounced it with a comical Scottish accent, \"did you ever have to go out in the rain with a cold?\"\n\n\"Definitely. Lots of times, probably.\"\n\n\"It's not, like, something you'd do if you didn't have to, but something about it can be really nice, right? Like a certain kind of comfortable that you can't feel otherwise.\"\n\nI wasn't used to Corby talking so specifically about feelings and sensations, but I really got what he was saying. I knew exactly that feeling. \"Yeah!\"\n\nHe said, \"It's like that, but you can choose what kind of cold you have.\"\n\nI don't remember what else we talked about, but the whole time, I felt *so strongly* like I was talking to Corby, and not what I was thinking about Corby. My memory is very spatial, and I think in a fairly literal sense that my memory of the bookstore is filled with ghosts of conversations with Corby, and it feels good to realize that that well isn't dry, that my mind can reach back and grab onto that feeling so completely. When he had to go, I told him how much I missed him, and how good it was to have known him. How he would have loved to meet Martha. I find myself having a lot of dreams lately where I get a chance to say the things I wish I could say to people in my past. Maybe that's a middle-age thing, mabe that's a 2024 thing, or maybe it's just happening. In any case, I'm going to be holding on to that feeling, firmly but lightly, of catching up with Corby in Dawn Treader Books today as M and I host about 15 people for Friendsgiving.",

    "raw_markdown": "The first bookstore I worked at was [[Dawn Treader Books]], a classic, all-topics used bookstore (with a particularly strong showing in fiction, especially science fiction). I was 17, and I had also recently started volunteering at WCBN, the community radio station. \n\nThis was the late 90s, and while I had done some internetting, it was still a remarkable thing to be surrounded by stacks of media. We were still more than a decade from being always within reach of a device with the ability to drown us in content. So these huge collections of books and records and CDs were magical in a way that's kind of hard to remember. Also, I was 17 and basically an idiot, so there was lots to discover.\n\nSomething kept happening at the bookstore or the radio station that made them seem extra magical. I'd somehow stumble across a book I had just read about in the last book I was reading, or an album that turned out to be the first project by members of the last band I really got into. Things like that.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that, while I wasn't looking for these, I was very actively rejecting other books and records literally by the _thousands_. Simply by scanning the fiction section, being paid minimum wage to shelve new arrivals, browsing the records at the station, I was _not_ picking up thousands of titles every week that didn't grab my attention. And then I was picking up dozens or maybe hundreds of other titles that didn't hold it. So this created this tremendous negative pressure that caused the important things to bubble to the top. \n\nMy career in used books ended when I went to art school seven years later, but I was into this idea enough that I consciously employed it in note taking and research for my dissertation. Or half-consciously, I guess -- you can't really do it on purpose.\n\nCan't say I've had a name for it this whole time, but it's an idea that feels solid to me. So if I'm gonna write it down let's call the phenomenon a slow-motion-bullseye. \n\nI think it's a nice motivation to stay curious -- keep up the curiosity and who knows how many perfect things to read or listen to or see are slowly approaching the bullseye of your attention from all angles!",

If it's all just a pile of Lego up there, (or [[urs]]) then Mind Things are pre-assembled chunks, whether they were deliberately created over painstaking study or just sort of glommed together coincidentally in the eddies of regular mental currents.\n\nMy idea of a Mind Thing is a less-romantic update of a well-loved mind thing I borrowed from Nabokov when I first read Ada when I was 16. \n\nSee [[Ada's three kinds of things]]\n\n\n\nHere's how I translate that to Mind Things\n\n**Things:** Songs that feel like old friends. All the sources cited in [[The Conceptual Labor Book|The Conceptual Labor Book]]\n\n**Real Things:** [[Pika's Place]]. [[Corby's Collages]].\n\n**Ghost Things:** [[The Mole Diagram]]. [[The Three Kinds of Things]]. [[Urs]].\n\n\nThis is definitely somewhat of a departure from the original, far more romantic structure, but it's a version I've worked with in my mind for a long time now.\n\n#### Things\n\nThings are more commodity-like, atoms of experience, pretty readily transmitted. The remembering is in the collecting of them. These seem to be pretty well-served by existing tools, analog or digital, and more in line with traditional means of archiving.\n\n#### Real Things\n\nReal Things don't quite exist without the rememberer's touch, without some interpretation. Possibly they require a production step -- they must be gone out and got, encountered before they can be collected.\n\n#### Ghost Things\n\nGhost Things are both the most real and unreal of things. I think they're a bit like the back of your head -- you need a mirror to see them and they never look quite right in the reflection, but without them your brain would fall out.\n\nI don't feel that confident in any other description of them yet, so I'm gonna keep trying to use this as a mirror and see if that gets us anywhere.",

And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets.

I think this was before we lived together, and _one_ of us was harshly shaming the _other_ after discovering a bag of dinner rolls in his kitchen that he had purchased for his own consumption.\n\nThe accused acknowledged the excess of this, but explained that, in a way, it's healthier. Because, though it was, objectively, a large quantity of refined carbs for one person to eat, it was fewer *bread times.*\n\nThe irony of this appeal is that it actually goes against the fully mature concept of *a time*. This was later acknowledged by the accused when he purchased a loaf of bread, which would provide more bread *times* over a smaller *quantity* of bread.\n\nSometimes you are hungry, and you need a certain amount of food. Sometimes you are in college, and you require a certain quantity of beer. But this is different than the desire for a *time.* The rise of high-quality non-alcoholic beverages is, I believe, and indicator of this. Sometimes -- often even -- you want a _beer time_ much more than you want a beer. Sometimes you want a snack _time_ more than you want a snack. Sometimes you want four times, but you are not hungry. That is ok. An awareness of _times_ as distinct from _amounts_ can liberate you from the tyranny of conventional consumption.",

    "raw_markdown": "Back in art school, I had a dream where I was trying to explain to my friend Greg a tension I was feeling with my studies. I went to art school to focus on being a painter, but once I got there I also joined a martial arts school, started my if-you're-going-to-get-a-degree-in-painting-you-have-to-learn-how-to-code bargain with myself, and was still writing all the time. I was supposed to be painting, but [The Thing I was Trying to Do](https://www.letstalkaboutpaintings.com/the-thing-i-am-trying-to-do) seemed to pop up in all those realms.\n\nSo in the dream, I drew a diagram on the wall of my studio to explain what I was trying to say to Greg.\n\n![A drawing of a cross section of the ground showing multiple tunnels coming down from the surface, branching off, joining, and then branching off again.](/assets/notes/mole-diagram.jpeg)\n\nThe idea was that for each thing you get interested in, you start digging down as you get further and further into it. But the tunnels aren't perfectly straight, and sometimes you get into something deep enough that it intersects with another tunnel by surprise, and you get a cave-in where a big shared conceptual space opens up. You're painting with paint but you realize you could do the same thing with thread. You develop a studio practice, but it turns out the mental state and the sensitivity you need there is also what you need when you practice Taiji. That kind of thing.\n\nAt the time, my big complaint was that there's certain levels, like a waterline, that if you dig past them everyone down there expects a certain fluency and commitment to whatever that particular tunnel is about. If you're down that far in a couple subjects without making connections, you have a really long mental journey when you're switching between disciplines. You gotta go all the way up one tunnel, across, and back down. I remember really feeling a palpable sense of disorientation going from long days in my studio to learning basic programming concepts and even just learning how to survive sitting in front of the computer for hours at a time.\n\nAnyway, when I got to the studio that day I told Greg about the dream, and then I drew the diagram on the wall, and he totally got it. That was satisfying.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "> This site came out of a year or so of experimenting with digital gardens. Here's what I wrote about how that started and some stuff I did to grow it. The [[Development Log]] has more up-to-date info about what's going on here.\n\n## How I Started this Garden\n\n4.18.22\n\nNo digital garden is complete without a good pile of notes about digital gardens themselves!\n\nLess than a month since reading this bittersweet thread 👇 from my friend [[Ryan]], who was, like, *there* when the web cut its own bangs for the first time, I've not only started a digital garden, I've extended its features and roped at least [[Evan|one friend]] into making [his own](https://evans-thoughts-garden.onrender.com).\n\n![Tweet from twitter user @sixfoot6 reading \"i barely think about the web we lost anymore tbh\"](/assets/notes/ryan-tweet-lost-web.png)\n\n\nA little ways down that [thread](https://twitter.com/sixfoot6/status/1506011362249437190), someone mentions digital gardening.\n\n![A tweet from @sixfoot6 reading \"the nostalgia and look backwards weren't taking me far, and faded. and none of the forward-looking discord something something web3 something personal blogs are back something something threads are really lighting me up either we're just here now.\" replied to by @Weegee saying \"I Hold on to people. Though I have been investigating digital gardens with remind me of the old web in a good way. Enjoyed it so far.\"](/assets/notes/original-digital-garden-tweet.png)\n\n\nIt was a term I'd heard before, but there was something about the specificity of how he said it that got me digging. You can see most of what I found and read at [[Digital Gardens]] and [[cozyweb]].\n\nIt was timely, because just a few days prior I had lucked into an actual evening of *web browsing* thanks to the excellent [random button on Marginalia search](https://search.marginalia.nu/explore/random).\n\n> Appropriately enough when I went to go get that link, I discovered that Marginalia has a [memex](https://memex.marginalia.nu), a central reference of one of the [instigating texts of the current movement of digital gardens](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/).\n\n> and holy shit they have a... [gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol))? [site](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gemini/marginalia.nu/)?\n> wow... brand new thing learned while writing this. this nerdrabbithole keeps getting deeper.\n\nLike Ryan and his friends in that thread, I've been casting about for ghosts of an internet time that I probably don't even remember correctly. Not just for nostalgia, though... for the reasons it was good in the first place. And I'm coming out of a five / ten year [writing project](https://conceptuallabor.com) with a pile of research and a great hunger for lighter, looser writing and free-association. This is its own rabbithole, and it's getting a little late, so in the discursive, anti-completist nature of digital gardens, I'll put a pin in this and come back to it. In any case I was hella primed to find out about this [whole pattern](https://conceptuallabor.com/blog/writing-tools-1) or writing and making websites.\n\n### This Garden's Harvests\n\nThat said, I am so far much more interested in the website-making rather than note-taking parts of digital gardens. That's reflected in my modifications thusfar to the really excellent [digital garden Jekyll template I'm using](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).\n\n#### I'm importing RSS feeds\n\nPinboard is totally central to my use of the internet. But, as the author of the Memex points out, we store much more information than we retrieve. I've wanted a better way to view and interact with my bookmarks and research for a long time.\n\nSo I banged together a [little ruby script](https://github.com/nimwunnan/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/getfeeds.rb) that does the following\n\n* turns entries from an RSS feed into markdown files in the collection `_feeds`\n* adds useful frontmatter such as tags and a default template\n* creates a `note` for every `tag` and `bucket` specified\n\t* for pinboard feeds, it includes the tags from pinboard for each item\n* adds backlinks to `feed` page content to their corresponding `bucket` note\n\n> I'd like to release this as an actual jekyll plugin. It needs some work first, and I'm not usually a ruby developer, but ruby's friendly enough. Anyway, I have to take a break from working *on* this garden to putting things *in* it, so stay tuned for that.\n\nSo far the external sites I've imported are:\n\n* [[astronomy-picture-of-the-day]]\n* [[public-domain-review]]\n* [[the-morning-news]]\n* and [[Martha]]'s excellent [[Grapefruits Sometimes Art Email]]\n\n~~and you can find allllll my bookmarks in the [[bookmarks]] bucket.\n~~\nBookmarks removed after the advent of  [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden)\n### I made some new templates\n\nVery quick and dirty so far. They serve two purposes: collecting groups of content, and making it possible for me to show [[Martha|Martha]] a garden of emoji plants. They're evident in the above links.\n\n1.15.23\n\n### New Garden of Blogs\n\nMoved feeds to [bloggy.garden](https://bloggy.garden). Made sense to make it it's own thing -- definitely still interested in the idea of pulling external content into the garden, but not as much as a browser / reader.",

And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.</p>\n"

    "raw_markdown": "# Brain Mulch and Mind Things\n\nIf only to be less confusing when I ramble about digital gardens and memexes and so on to [[Martha]], I've been trying to figure out a clear difference between the two ideas, or at least how I'm approaching them.\n\nDigital Gardening seems more geared towards [[Brain Mulch]] -- notes about stuff, bookmarks or saved thoughts or links, encouraged to build up, ferment, and grow into more thinglike-things, but remain content with the mulching process.\n\n### On \"knowledge management\"\n\n> One thing I learned trying that for a year is that the specter of PKM or \"personal knowledge management\" that looms over all these ideas makes me want to barf. The public-note-taking part of it feels performative and is a terrible fit for my existing, useful research processes. It feels more like Digital Monoculture Hydroponics instead of gardening, crammed into a pyramid scheme where everyone's just writing about how much more productive they are with their projects (which are mainly writing about how productive they are). Also, I swear there's a PKM-to-Jordan-Peterson pipeline. bah.\n\nThat said, by writing this I'm *currently* enjoying some new benefits of the idea of public note taking. I'm not super intent on other people reading this and caring, but the idea that they might feels like it's tightening up my thinking, like cooking a quick meal for another person instead of just your self. And my chain of messy, three-quarters-finished documents that I chucked into Garden 1.0 did help me figure some stuff out to get here. On the flip side, I can't ever see a benefit to making public the version of that I have for painting -- a sprawling, decade-old set of documents I just call \"Studio Journal.\"\n\n### A Goal:\n\nJust for me, I would love to connect everything I have that's *like* my studio journal, across the spectrum of private to public, so that I have the biggest pile of Brain Mulch I can make, and that it's easy to extract sharable Mind Things when they come up.\n\n## Puttin in mind things\n\nMany of the things that make me go \"I should put that in the memex\" are familiar entries in my brain, things I refer back to often. Decided to call these [[Mind Things]]. (I think Brain Mulch is where you can grow new Mind Things?) After enough years of changing devices or changing where I put things online the idea that there could be even semi-complete feeling, navigable *external* archive of the shelves and galleries in my brain that I consult in the studio or in conversation when I'm writing is, like, **the** main reason I'm building this. Jeez that would be nice.\n\nI think the sense that most options are built on damp sand, as it were, has prevented me from really ever using any platform to its fullest potential. I'm always impressed when someone can do that. Feels like [[Case]] has accomplished that. So I think I have *many* collections that are entirely in my head that *feel* like they're a real thing out in the world, but then I try to send my friends a link and the dream evaporates. (If any of you read that and were like \"yeah, me too\", *please do share!*)\n\n\n\n**An example:** For a long time I've had a notion of The Shelf -- the idea that everyone has a set of core texts that have shaped the way they see the world, or at the very least come up all the time.

    "raw_markdown": "Buckmanite, or Buckman Slate, is a metamorphic substance endemic to many urban environments, but first identified in the Buckman neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. It is a composite material formed when plastic municipal containers undergo rapid exothermic reactions, deforming to bond with the surrounding environment. These reactions are most often triggered by human intervention, both accidental and intentional, but theoretically could be triggered by natural phenomena such as lightning or incidental lensing of sunlight through nearby mirrors or windows during a heatwave. \n\n![A Typical depost of Buckmanite](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Deposit Typical.jpeg)\n\nBuckmanite usually ranges from dark to light blue in appearance, while green, brown, and even yellow varieties have been identified. When fully formed, Buckmanite is usually found in wide, pool-like deposits characterized by an irregular, layered surface, mechanically bonded to the ground substrate. Buckmanite is unusual in its ability to form novel cement-like structures and fuse with existing cement or composite materials.\n\n### Buckmanite as cement matrix\n\nMany factors influence the composition of Buckmanite. The time of year, time of day, microclimate, and even the side of the street on which Buckmanite forms can dictate the internal structure of the material. Substances within and without the original form of the container will become suspended in the transformed material. These include leaves, inorganic refuse, and grains of sidewalk or asphalt up to 1cm across. \n\n### Buckmanite as cement ingredient\n\nSignificant deposits can be easily removed with common hand tools, but thinner layers may integrate so fully into their environment as to become a permanent feature. Pre-transformation, the polymer components of Buckmanite are fully mobile in relation to the cement surfaces of its typical environment. The energetic process of its formation bonds the material to its hyperlocal environment. In this way the material represents a transition from container to surface.\n\n![Buckmanite in the process of merging with its envirionment](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite - Typical Substrate Partial Formation Close View.jpeg)\n\n\nEven partial formation of Buckmanite is enough to cause an ontological metamorphosis of its source materials. Here, a container has lost its internality and has become refuse in need of containing.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite Disposal.jpeg)\n\n### Exotic components\n\nBuckmanite is defined by a process and location as much as it is by pure material composition. Many different possible structures and appearances of Buckmanite have been theorized. Pictured here is a dramatic example of the incomplete formation of Buckmanite from an atypical source. Note that the original structure was not able to sustain an exothermic reaction long enough to fully transform.\n\n![Buckmanite being disposed of](/assets/buckmanite/Buckmanite%20-%20Atypical%20Substrate%20%20Partial%20Formation.jpeg)\n\n### Environmental Indicator\n\nWhile the physical components of Buckmanite are common, its formation most typically occurs within specific sociological conditions. These conditions can be grouped as **Ignition Conditions** and **Formation Conditions.**\n\n## Ignition conditions\n\nA primary condition seems to be the intersection of consistent on-street activity within residential or mixed-use neighborhoods. The housed population and local businesses are responsible for the continued presence of refuse containers, and enough range of on-street activity will provide an ongoing presence of unsanctioned interactions (ie any interaction not within the [use permitted by the city](https://www.portland.gov/bps/garbage-recycling/garbage-recycling-and-compost-rules-and-regulations) or private owners of the containers). The combination, will, in select circumstances, provide the conditions required to ignite the material. \n\nFolk theories tend to assign responsibility to unhoused or otherwise indigent actors, but ample field observations contradict this theory. The crucial criteria here is *activity on the street.* Whether that activity comes from a housed or unhoused population is not relevant. Whether or not formation conditions exist, ignition conditions are frequently met by affluent residents of or visitors to neighborhood with a high density of alcohol-serving establishments or proximity to major sporting arenas. The common misconception that ignition conditions are necessarily intentional has been repeatedly disproven. In fact, accidental ignition is perhaps even more common than intentional.\n\n## Formation conditions\n\nPerhaps as part of some form of ecological homeostasis, the conditions required for Buckmanite formation only exist in regions with inorganic substrates and little vegetation. Were refuse containers to be commonly found in rural or forested areas, ignition would likely cause a wildfire. Buckmanite exists in a space between controlled and wild environments. A refuse container completely destroyed by a wildfire is not recognizable as Buckmanite, just as a simple garbage fire that fails to bond with its neighborhood also fails to qualify as this unique substance.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nMuch like other modern minerals such as [Fordite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordite), Buckmanite is a material formed a specific time and place, reflecting the cultural conditions of its site. \n\n## Gallery\n\nPlease enjoy this gallery of [[Buckmanite Samples]]\n\n\n",

Dorians, as everyone in the world of the dream already knew, were a beloved European cookie, as reknowned and revered as the Madelines and Financiers of our world.\n\n> Now, before I describe them, I have to admit that I have been talking about them with Martha and our friends so intently  (*fig 1*) since this dream that what follows is not a direct account of my dream as much as it is a confection of the collective, half-awake dream of Dorians that my friends and I have cultivated.\n\n![A set of texts describing the lore of Dorains as: Papa would always take me to Monsieur Dorian's bakery on the way to the trolly stop in winter and i would open the wax paper packet while looking out the window of the tram as the city flew by and the smell of warm almond, fresh orange, and dark chocolate would fill my cold, runny nose.](/assets/notes/dorian-fig-1.jpeg)\n\n*Figure 1*\n\nBorn during the final days of the Austrio-Hungarian empire in a small family bakery (which, according to dream logic, was still operating out the of original location while simultaneously being long-since closed), Dorians were created to offer an uncompromisingly refined pastry experience that could be enjoyed by the cosmpolitan citizens on the go in the modern city, whether socialite, worker, child, artist, or nobility. They are a sandwich cookie consisting of two dense but airy almond flour discs, held together by a thin layer of chocolate ganache with hints of orange zest. The top cookie has a circular hole in the center, like a Linzer cookie, which holds extra ganache. In the dream they were served individually wrapped in a clamshell of two pieces of wax paper, crimped on the sides like a muffin wrapper. The top piece had an ornate, art-nouveau design stamped in pale green or orange, sinuous vines and snake-like ornaments surrounding the word \"Dorians\" in stylized letters in the center.\n\n![A basket with a stack of Dorian cookies in wax paper wrappers](/assets/notes/dorians-in-basket.jpeg)\n\nLike espresso, they are meant to be enjoyed on the go -- not idly munched, but savored in a brief lacunae between the demands of the day. They are said to be best shortly after cooling -- neither too soft nor too stale, so they were baked throughout the day in small batches. Only one batch per day of \"Famous Dorians\" would be made, which were fully covered in a shell of chocolate. In many cities, these were almost all reserved for the children of influential citizens and for the classier brothels, which would serve them to their regulars with a shot of chartreuse.\n\nThough a simple recipe and sold at a modest but fair price, Dorians provided a sophisticated moment of private delight to anyone who stopped to buy one after glimpsing a fresh batch in the window on their way to and from appointments in their cosmopolitan life.\n\nThanks to [[Martha]], we can see what Dorians look like today. Thanks to me and excitement at being surprised with real Dorians on my birthday, we can only see what half of one looks like.\n\n![Half a Dorian cookie in a wax paper envelope.](/assets/notes/dorian-snack.jpeg)\n\nThese are almond sable held together with chocolate ganache dressed with wisps of candied orange peel in the center. Three  changes from my dream that Martha made that I highly approve of are the square, open envelopes, the candied orange peel, and the egg wash on the top cookie. I think these all make sense.\n\n- the open envelope says, yes, these are to-go, but not to be thrown in a purse or a pocket and forgotten about. They are to be eaten on-your-way\n- the candied orange peel is an excellent dash of extra luxury\n- An egg-wash is not something my dream brain knows about, and it is something that actual pastry chefs do know about and recommend. Maybe it even makes them less crumbly?\n\nShe surprised me with these for my 43rd birthday, and the first bite was incredible!\n\nWe will make more so that perhaps one day, all of you can enjoy a Dorian.\n\n",

What follows is the review I sent by text upon receiving the package:\n\nThe bilingual packaging leads me to believe that these are Canadian, which, after my first taste is no surprise. Whatever eldritch pact our neighbors to the north have made with Big Chip, it's worth it. They seem to have access to consistently more adventurous flavors of chip than us, and the mainstream popularity of All Dressed -- an obvious jumping-off point for Magic Masala -- indicates that some significant portion of Canadian society is willing to experience more than one flavor at a time. I imagine Canada would crumble without them.\n\nSpeaking of crumbles, the delivery method of this third of a bag of Magic was surprisingly workable -- many large, whole chips remained. Which is good, as the blast of flavor deserves whole-tongue contact. There was actual heat, a melange of the orange and red flavors that one can rely on All Dressed to provide, and then... something earthier. Something more. Grassy, almost a whiff of egg. One of the more complex chips I've had. A delight, and a welcome challenge.",

    "raw_markdown": "![A handmade remote that looks like garbage you'd want to throw away](/assets/notes/my-remote.jpeg)\n\nMy friend Jayne's dad gave her, unsolicited, a set of three remote-operated outlets when she was living in a studio apartment where it might have been possible to reach all of her light switches at once. Solid Dad move. She gave them to me to use in my chaotic art studio, which was very appreciated. However, out of the box the range was about 6 feet, which made these about as useful as a long broom handle. Less, if you consider that you can also use a broom handle for a broom. I fiddled with them and discovered that the housing was shielding the signal, and the antenna was really fragile. So I soldered some speaker wire in place of the old antennas and ran it outside the terminals. That worked, but the remote was pretty flimsy. So... obviously the solution was to make it out of bookboard and aluminum tape. It still works, but you really gotta mash on it. Martha says this remote is her ideal of all technology.",

I mentioned The Street Potato in that way you remove detail when talking about something that has an extensive entry in your brain but you are talking to someone who might not know what you're talking about or possibly think you're somewhat crazy if you talked about it in the detail you think of it. To be clear -- I *knew* Andrea would be down with it, but didn't want to assume she had noticed it.\n\n\"Oh you mean the one up on Ankeny??\"\n\nYeah, she had noticed it.\n\nInstantly, all three of us dropped our filters and started comparing notes about the life of The Street Potato in full detail.\n\nThe Street Potato lives (died?) on a short block lined by two generic, new-construction apartment buildings. The building to the north has a half-block-long garage door and a bunch of balconies full of stuff but never people. The smaller building to the south has a row of street-level windows, most of which have a cat or evidence of a cat in them. On the sidewalk in front of the row of cat windows, some time in the early spring -- possibly even the late winter -- a large, apparently-cooked sweet potato appeared on the sidewalk. At least half of it was somewhat *in* the sidewalk -- stomped or splattered into the concrete such that The Street Potato was not about to roll away. Since then, it appears to have taken up permanent residence in that spot.\n\n\n### My theory of The Street Potato\n\n\n**I think it was thrown or otherwise ejected from a window**\n\nEvidence:\n- I believe about 75% of it flattened upon contact with the sidewalk.\n- The force to de-cohere so much of a good-sized sweet potato requires more acceleration than it would get by simply being dropped from the carrying height of an average adult.\n- It landed about ten feet from the building, farther than it would have if it simply fell.\n- This also means it was probably fully cooked.\n\n**It embodies the universe's infinite capacity for change.**\n\n- As *I* recall, it started out as recognizable sweet potato, sticking out of the sidewalk like it had clipped through it in a video game.\n- Someone stepped on it within the first few weeks of its life on the sidewalk.\n\t- This means they were probably looking at a cute cat in the window, or the abject  emptiness of the giant garage door.\n- Since being stepped on, it has been functionally two-dimensional.\n- It is at least 4 months old.\n\t- I am writing this in August. It was definitely there in April. I don't know what this means.\n\n[[Martha]] has a different theory -- the potato fell from a bag while being carried to or from some sort of dinner function, and the potato-dropper immediately slipped in the potato, grinding it into the sidewalk, perhaps with the classic slapstick slipping-on-a-banana pratfall.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "![A Thinkpad X220 laptop on a table with an espresso next to it outside on a city street](/assets/notes/screb.jpeg)\n\nI'm typing this in 2024 on a 2011 Lenovo Thinkpad x220 named Screb, and it's pretty fun. I have it because of an x200 I got to use on a long trip on the Siberian Express that my sister took me on in 2013. My first laptop ever was a cheap-and-old-even-at-the-time Thinkpad that I got in 2000 mainly so I could write whatever it was that I was writing at the age of 20 on my lunchbreak at work (because, you know, files mostly existed in a physical locations then so I needed a way to bring them with me). I remembered it fondly, so when I needed a computer that could keep me reasonably connected with work but also get crushed by a train without it being a big problem, I went for a ~$200 x200. It was honestly pretty usable!\n\nThen, around 2020, I was in one of those situations with an internet service provider that involves hours of unpaid work to prove that they're gaslighting you, and I had to find a device that plugged directly into ethernet, and, lo, there was my old x200. \n\nTwo remarkable things came out of this. One, a laptop running Linux that had been powered down for six years went through about 20 minutes of software updates and was good as new. Two, I saved my studio from burning down because its aftermarket battery was growing an enormous bubble and if I hadn't dug that laptop out of storage it probably would have exploded soon thereafter.\n\nSo that's good.\n\nI ended up selling that and getting the just-better-enough x220, and did a decent amount of actual freelance work and writing on it. It's definitely a better typewriter than development machine, which is mostly what I use it for now.\n\nBut it's excellent at that! I had been running Kubuntu on it, which had some nice quality of life things, but I could _not_ get the power management under control. It regularly got hot enough to be uncomfortable on an actual human lap (mine), though the overheating vintage electronics smell the fan blew out was oddly nostalgic and pleasant.\n\nI recently scrubbed it and installed Mint, which seems to have solved the problem. I get a few hours out of it, and it stays quiet and cool.\n\nAt the moment, all it has is Obsidian, Dropbox, Firefox, and an email client on it and that's _delightful._\n\nNo notifications, *very* comfortable keyboard, dedicated keys for page up/down and browse back/forward, and a little light in the lid that shines down on the keyboard. [And the weird nub mouse thing](https://xkcd.com/243/).\n\nThis is one of those devices that has developed an intense and dedicated following -- you can buy an _x330_ now, which is not a model that was ever issued. Modders have put together an impressive suite of hacks and upgrades to make their own, new beast. As far as I ever got sucked in was installing an mSata hard drive to dual boot Windows and then modifying the BIOS to run some containerized client software -- which I am glad not to be doing anymore. [Some guy once called it the Toyota Corolla of laptops](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/why-i-use-a-thinkpad-x220-in-2021), and I agree. Wait, that's not just some guy, that's Maxime Vaillancourt, _the guy_ who wrote the Digital Garden Theme that I used as a starting point to build this memex! Clearly only geniuses use this laptop.\n\nMainly, I like it as a calm, solid feeling device that lets me do a few, focused things and doesn't interrupt me when I do.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "## The challenge\n\nCreate a signature sandwich that exemplifies what you, in your heart, truly believe is the best of what a sandwich can offer. Share it with friends in good natured competition. Partake in each other's sandwiches, and taste the unique visions of your friends.\n\n## The Rules\n\n- The sandwich must be unique to you. This could be your own version of an existing sandwich, or something completely original.\n- Keep your sandwich secret until the event.\n- Make three identical versions of the same sandwich.\n\t- One for reference\n\t- One for the judges\n\t- One to share with your fellow sandwich artists.\n- Present your sandwich with a small side and beverage.\n- What defines and constitutes a sandwich is up to you, as long as you can justify it.\n- You are not required to make every component of the sandwich. Much of the art of sandwiches is curation, so what you choose to put in is as important as what you make yourself.\n- *However*, you must be the only sandwich artist. No teams.\n\n## The Contest\n\nA panel of three judges will sample and score your sandwich according to three categoreis. All judgement is relative to each sandwich's vision, not based on an ideal of what a sandwich should be:\n\n1. Taste\n2. Presentation -- This includes structure, plating, and preparation. \n3. Concept -- This doesn't imply *high concept.* Simply -- what have you tried to do, and how well did you do it? It could be simply \"this is what a sloppy joe means to me\" or as complex as \"this sandwich expresses the life and accomplishments of Klaus Nomi\"\n\n## Logistics\n\n**When:** Last week of September\n\n**Where:** TBD -- please report your prep needs to Ním, and he will figure out the best venue to suit everyone. Possibly it will be his house, but who knows.\n\n**Why:** Do you even need to ask.\n\n### Influences\n\nTo be clear, I don't think you should make a sandwich that tastes *like your personality*, but, after seeing [[Caitlyn]]'s [potato tattoo](https://wayside.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin%27s_Big_Decision), I think this might be subconsciously influenced by [Sideways Stories From Wayside School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideways_Stories_from_Wayside_School). Specifically the chapter *Maurecia*, in which ice cream flavors are made that so perfectly reflect the personalities of each student that no one can taste their own flavor. According to [shmoop.com's study guide](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/sideways-stories-from-wayside-school/maurecia-flavored-ice-cream-symbol.html) for this chapter:\n\n> The strangeness of person-flavored ice cream aside, this means that the ice cream is a symbol for getting to know people. You never know who you'll end up liking if you just give them a chance… or a lick, as the case may be. Plus each flavor is different, which also reminds us that the kids at Wayside—just like the rest of us—are each unique and wonderful in their own way.\n\nI do 100% endorse the idea that your sandwiches should remind us that we are each unique and wonderful in our own way.\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "DOES THIS WORK [cozyweb][#cozyweb]???\n\nHOW BOUT DIS\n  <octo-thorpe>\n    digitalGardens\n  </octo-thorpe>\n---\n\nSHRUGGIE\n\nI had a 15 mile hiking day in [[canyonlands]] and thought about digital gardens until my brain melted. I dumped my thoughts about this project on [[Nik]] and he dumped them back in a [much prettier pile](https://garden.nikolas.ws/thinking-about-octothorpes/).\n\n\n[Social Web Protocol is interesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/social-web-protocols)\n\n[DBPedia would be cool if it worked](https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org)\n\n# 5.9.2022\n\nHad a chance to look at [Dorian Taylor's](https://doriantaylor.com) library of[ RDF for Ruby](https://github.com/doriantaylor/rb-rdf-sak) stuff. [[Nik]] is super into his stuff, and have chatted with him briefly because of this on twitter. Obvs knows a lot about all of this.\n\nOverall, my interest in digital gardens is I'm trying to stick to \"what goes in the frame\" than \"how is the frame built\". Of course, the whole octothorpe idea is very, very much a frame idea. With that in mind, and with the world benefitting from excellent frame-makers like Dorian, my hunch is that I want an in-the-middle approach like so:\n\n* Leave the website making to the things that make websites -- Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js, whatever\n* It's ok for people to use their website-makers to make connections and meaning on their website in their usual way\n* Use the RDF layer to do all the mapping / relating / remaking\n\n### This means:\n\n* Any RDF and linked-data patterns should be able to read the cliff-notes version of this meaning and these connections (ie a Jekyll plugin that can convert tags / layouts to metadata)\n* I think the canonical urls for a markdown-based SSG should be raw markdown files with rich frontmatter\n* Octothorpes is a service that doesn't care how your site is made, and expects to look at markdown files like that\n* Lightweight plugins / converters maintined within the ecosystems of website-makers take care of going from Their Way of Doing Things to producing these canonical markdown files\n* How much metadata goes into a human-readable public url is decided within the website-making step\n* Octothorpes as a service a human would use does the following:\n\t* parses and associates the meaning of the metadata on canonical urls with the content (markdown) within an namespace\n\t* generates the relevant JSON-LD for that namespace\n\t* coordinates / distributes resources like the plugins that a SSG would use to hook into the Octothorpoes ecostytem\n\t* provides JS interfaces for the core features of the Octothorpes ecosystem to plunk in on sites that don't use / have access to the above plugins ^. Eg:\n\t\t* simple D3-like graph visualization of related content\n\t\t* in-line activation of \"octothorped\" terms\n\t\t* backlinks\n\t* provides an infinite and growing set of visualizations, connections, remixes, etc from it's galaxy of linked data... lalaal whatever this is the \"future is bright / open source everything\" part of the roadmap\n\t\t* *This* step is where you would generate actual webpages from pure RDF / OWL / JSON-LD whathave you. This is fine, but I don't think we should *start* there.\n\n\nSo this represents a pretty big departure from Dorian's project. His swiss-army knife is super cool and interesting, but too unwieldy to carry in your pocket everywhere\n\nI'm lookin [at this stuff](https://github.com/ruby-rdf/). Ecosystem seems healthy and well maintained.\n\n# 12.26.22\n\nWe wrote version 1 in our heads, so why not make a spec for Version 2 before we actually write it in code\n\n\n# Octothorpes\n\nOctothorpes is a lightweight protocol for creating bidirectional links and event streams between documents, regardless of whether the documents are accessible via local or networked protocols. The octothorpe ecosystem consists of:\n\n* documents\n\t* content\n\t* yaml frontmatter\n* an octothorpes parser\n* an octothorpes server\n\nWrite **documents** in plaintext or markdown, describe them with basic YAML frontmatter.\nRun an octothorpes parser to create meaningful records that describe the documents and their relationships to other records.\n\n> A Parser runs in the same environment where you access the documents. For example, if you were writing documents in markdown files on your own machine, you would use the Octothorpes CLI. If you are writing them in Wordpress on a public blog, you would use an embedded script or Wordpress plugin.\n\n**An Octothorpes parser** creates descriptive RDF records for each of your documents. These records can contain the full content of your documents, or simply a reference to a canonical source of a document's content. Parsers deal with the following entities:\n\n* Document records\n* Backlinks \n* Octothorpe Terms (also known simply as `octothorpes`)\n* User terms\n\n\n### Octothorpes server\n\n\nConnect your parser to an **octothorpe server** to relate your parsed documents to other documents and terms. A `server` reads the RDF created by parsers and provides an API for interacting with that information. Octothorpe servers respond to requests for all of the above entities and handle the following **Events**\n\n* [All ActivityPub actions](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n* Sync\n* Transform\n* Feed\n\n## Entities\n\n\n### Document records\n\nParsing a document creates a descriptive record of a document that is treated as a permanent ID for that document in the Octothorpes ecosystem. \n\n> todo: document spec.\n> I think docs should only require title, alias, terms, mode (r,w,x), and content (reference or canonical)\n> but feels like more thinking is required.\n\n**Canonical document records**\n\nOptionally, the content of a document can be stored in the document record and treated as the canonical version. Separate files or URLS can be created from a canonical document record via Events, according to access rights a Server has to the environment in which those files exist. Setting a document record's mode to `read-write` requires converting it to a `CDR`. `CDRs` could also be used when moving a set of documents to a new environment, preventing accidental editing of a document, or, conversely, if your preferred method of editing a document is with a (currently nonexistent) document record editor application.\n\n\n### Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are bidirectional links between documents. Since Octothorpes uses RDF descriptions of your documents, these *can* be hyperlinks but *don't have to be.* A backlink is simply a bidirectional relationship between any two documents the Octothorpes Server can identify. An octothorpes server includes backlink relationship information with any request for a document, and can respond to direct requests for backlink nodes.\n\n> todo: resolve backlink concept with activitypub \n> maybe a good [ref here](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-activitypub)?\n\n### Octothorpe Terms\nWhereas backlinks describe a relationship between documents, Octothorpe Terms -- or simply `octothorpes` -- describe a relationship between a document and a universal term. A document that is octothorped with the term `#octothorpe` has a potential relationship to every other accessible document with the same octothorpe. \n\n**Browsing and following octothorpes**\n\nOctothorpe servers provide an API for all the terms and documents they know about. If this API is made public, it can be subscribed to or manually interacted with via ActivityStreams / ActivityPub protocols, or a `feed` request.\n\n> Example: Nik subscribes a private Octothorpes server (Server A) and subscribes to the popular public server octothorp.es. (Server B). Nim only subscribes to Server B, but  When Nik issues a request for the octothorpe `#wombats` he sees results from Servers A and B. Nim will only see results from Server B.  \n\n\n## User terms\nAn arbitrary number of terms can be associated with a document record. These can be as simple as plaintext tags or a full schema such as SKOS.\n\n> By default, Parsers should be able to read and write User terms as [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#object) and [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/)\n\n\n## Events\n\n**Sync** \n\n`Sync` is used to copy content between environments, according to the access rights of those environments.\n\nAssuming the user has appropriate rights and access in both the environment where the `Server` they `sync` to and the `Parser` that issues the request,the requested `server` will respond with the canonical content and all terms for the requested `document record`.\n\nThe `parser` which issued the `sync` request then creates an associated `document record` . Environment variables or request params can be used to set whether that `document record` uses the original as its canonical reference, creates a new file to reference, or creates a new `CDR` backlinked to the original `document record`. \n\nIf the `mode` is set to `read-write` a sync request can be sent with an `overwrite` flag, which will update the `document record` with the canonical content of a separate `document record.` \n\n**Transform**\n\n`transform` is a read-only version of `sync` that can map `document record` attributes to an arbitrary set of outputs according to schema definitions provided to the `parser` in the form of JSON / JSON-LD. This is mainly a convenience function for `parsers`, as the response from the `server` will be the same as a `sync` request, but upon success will trigger further work by the `parser` that issued the request, according to env variables, request params, and schema definitions. \n\n> Example 1: Nim writes documents in Obsidian and publishes them on a Jekyll site. Both allow backlinking via alias but use different terms to define the alias. He sets up a simple schema definition that converts the `alias` term to a `title` term. He then uses the Octothorpes CLI to `transform` documents within his working directory using the `obsidian-jekyll` schema, outputting them as markdown files in his specified Jekyll directory. \n> Example 2: Retweet the web. Nik reads an article he likes on a blog that provides public `document records` for each of its articles. Using a bookmarklet authenticated to his private `server`, he can send a `transform` request to his server which will convert the `document record` of the blog article he's reading into a document format that his own website uses, creating a `backlink` to the original `document record` in the process.\n\n**Feed**\n\nThe `feed` request will create an rss/xml/whatever feed based on request parameters or `server` defaults when sent. \n\n> Example: Nik and Nim create a shared, private `server` that they both `sync` their notes to. They don't feel like creating a website, but they want to share what they're working on. So they set a public endpoint for `feed?authors=Nik-nim&format=rss-rdf` that allows anyone to subscribe via RSS. Of course, the feed includes well-formed `document records` by default, so anyone running their own `server` locally can easily `transform` that feed into any format they want.\n\n## 10.28.23\n\nFinally reading my paper copy of Literary Machines properly after showing the memex to my sister.\n\nmisread the instructions on how to navigate the book as having multiple levels of significant underlining. as in a double or single underline have distinct meaning. maybe octothorpe notation is a double underline?\n\n[#cozyweb]: https://octothorp.es/~/cozyWeb?/=tag/cozyweb",

    "raw_markdown": "There was a particularly strong thread that ran through most of my conversations at [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) this year. It was braided from questions (pleas?) like the following:\n\n- what's wrong with the internet now\n- can we make it not poisonous again\n- could we even make it fun again\n- what about all those sites we used to make for ouselves\n- how can we find the people and communities doing that now\n\nBefore the talks, this wasn't much of a surprise. I was there in large part to talk about these things! Nik and I had purposely busted ass to get [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es/) ready to share because XOXO seemed like the biggest gathering we could find of people who would get it. (Briefly, Octothorpes are hashtags and backlinks you can use on independent sites. You can read *a lot more* starting from [the guide we made for XOXO.](https://octothorp.es/xoxo2024.html)) I had just written essays called [We really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/) and  [We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-got-used-to-talking-to-the-internet-itself-instead-of-people-on-the-internet/) as a way of explaining why we were making Octothorpes. So this was on my mind.\n\nWe hoped to find a few people who were asking similar questions. I was *not* expecting that nearly everyone I talked to was likely to bring these questions up *first*. And when they seemed to form a powerful, unifying chain of critique and inquiry and hope through the main talks... I think I actually pumped my fist in the air a few times.\n\n\n## Tracing the thread\n\nSome points on the line, in chronological order:\n\n*note: most of these quotes are from memory. Once the recordings of the talks are posted I'll link to them and correct anything here. Feel free to correct me if you have notes.*\n\n[Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com/) says \"**Indie is just an economic descriptor**\" in his funny, insightful talk about the highs and lows of trying to make it building independent projects and communities on the internet, in part as a followup to his 2014 talk \"[How I Won The Lottery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw)\" This was to say that it's a way of existing in the market, rather than a coherent aesthetic or a value system, and it can be liberating or fuck you up in equal measures.\n\nSomeone? says something to the effect \"**We used to do weird things on the internet and then at some point it started doing weird things to us?**” Interestingly, when I tried to clarify who said this on the XOXO slack, it was clear that this could be considered one of the main themes of the festival. Someone else asked Andy Baio, one of the organizers, if this was on purpose. He responded that, while he had themes in mind when inviting speakers, they were ultimately in control of their own talks. He didn't even see the talks before they presented live, so this solid theme we felt mostly came together organically.\n\nDefinitely [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/) asked the room to **remember the time they felt embodied excitement, like in the pit of their stomach, about making something on the internet**. Her example was building her user profile page (called a lookup) on Neopets. She challenged us to find that feeling again with what we do now. The crowd was stoked.\n\n[Erin Kissane](https://erinkissane.com/), with great generosity and attention, told her story of gathering countless friends and strangers via the internet to process early COVID data. How it became the foundation for whatever public understanding we had of the pandemic, and what that community of purpose meant to her. This structured her nuanced critique of the current state of the internet. She implored us not to take a \"dark forest\" approach in leaving the sites of the current online toxicity. Both so these networks of care and shared concern could still form in public, and so that there was somewhere for those who come next to go. Instead, she gave us the rallying cry **Fix the fucking networks.** It's a line that I know many people in the last week or so have written down in their own accounts and web logs.\n\n[Ed Yong's](https://edyong.me/) moving, personal talk brought it home about both what one could do with the internet and what it could do to you. It was so open-hearted and immediate and personal that I don't really feel like I can or should try to summarize it here, only to say that when I do post the video you should definitely watch it all. In it, he said something along the lines that **we'll look back on the era where we put our random thoughts online for milions of strangers to read like we look back on when we built houses with asbestos.** This was greeted with ripples of laughter and then applause, filtered through I believe both relief and regret.\n\nOur through-line so far, paraphrased:\n\n- Indie just means out there on your own. And that can be pretty hard.\n- We used to do weird things on the internet, and now it does weird things to us.\n- Try to remember when making things on the internet felt creative and exciting.\n- We need to fix the fucking networks if we want to hang on to that feeling, and be safe out there on our own, while still being able to find each other.\n- Massive social media feeds are acute *and* chronic health hazards.\n\nSo, the way people talked about \"being on the internet\" at the last XOXO, in 2019, felt, uhh, *different* than this. This felt like a \"Frogs that jumped out of the pot[^1]\" conference. A \"How do we deal with the fact that society and most of our livlihoods have oriented themselves to this boiling pot of water that towers over our every waking moment while all we want to do is hop around and catch flies?\"\n## Next -- the IndieWeb becomes or remains discourse\n\nWhile mulling this all over in the last week, I came across some posts, on independent blogs, that seemed to be part of this zeitgeist for the open internet. They were both for small and personal websites and critical of some of the largest current projects working towards independent and non-commercial internet spaces, the IndieWeb and Fediverse movements.\n\nRoughly in order that I read them:\n\n- [Yelling at Clouds](https://manuelmoreale.com/yelling-at-the-web-clouds) by Manuel Morale\n- [IndieWeb's 3 Body Problem](https://so1o.xyz/blog/3-body-problem) by Solo\n- [Smaller](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/smaller/) by Simone Silvestroni\n- [Has the IndieWeb become Irrelevant](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html) by Matthew Graybosch\n- [The Social Web](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-social-web) by Manuel Morale\n\nAnd responses from the IndieWeb community:\n- [Has the IndieWeb become discourse again?](https://martymcgui.re/2024/08/29/141602/) by Marty McGuire\n- [Ownership, connection, and control](https://json.blog/2024/08/29/ownership-connection-and.html) by Jason Becker\n\n\nA lot of it is inside-baseball for a small community, and I don't even think it registers on the internet drama scale. I agree with a many of the specific points from the critical side, enough that I'm already building something that I think aligns with many of them, but I also agree with much of the responses from the IndieWeb community, who are all, in all of my experience, friendly, welcoming, and open minded people. If this is stuff you already care about, I do encourage you to read all these posts. But, with the thread from XOXO running through my thoughts, here's a summary of what I thought was most compelling from these posts.\n\n- If you want to be an individual who writes stuff on a website who talks to other individuals about it, email, a webpage, and RSS do really well for that. You might not need more than that.\n- We should critically assess the benefits of integration between \"websites\" and \"platforms\"\n- The Fediverse largely reproduces patterns designed by corporate social media, just with a better ownership model. Let's critically assess those patterns.\n- However accessible non-commercial internet authorship tools are trying to be, a lot of people -- perhaps most -- still find the bar too high.\n- No one can agree on what \"IndieWeb\" or \"indie web\" really means\n- We're even having a hard time agreeing what \"the social web\" means\n\nHere's what stuck out to me about the *context* in which these posts are being discussed:\n\n- These posts are all in conversation, almost all of them from the last few weeks, on static, self-made websites, and most of the authors insist on email as the main channel of response.\n- People are having substantive conversations about a topic that matters to them, and being pretty articulate, nuanced, and respectful about it even when they're disagreeing. \n- The posts have reached people outside of the author's immediate community without the authors promoting them on any platforms\n\n\nReading this conversation felt like hearing from frogs that got out of the pot before it got warm. I think, in general, those are good people to listen to in whatever context you encounter them. But...\n\nIt is very easy to go, fuck yeah, out with the new, in with the old, let's make the internet sane and quiet and small. But... \n\nIt's very hard to balance that with Erin Kissane's call to action. As she said in her talk, she and her army of volunteers should never have had to step in to do the work we expect our governments to do in a pandemic. But now we have the tools for citizens to self-organize *en masse* about issues they care about, so we should think very critically about dismantling them before the next pandemic. How do we balance these concerns?\n\n\n## The Active Web\n\nHere I am participating in discourse, in relatively real-time. How did I get into it? I saw a [post by Sarah Joy on Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sarajw/113035847169727351) that linked to a post that linked to this. So a combination of the convenience of a social feed, and the small web's call to browse.\n\nThe double edged sword of convenience is that it's accessible, but it's also exploitable. In America, a \"convenience\" store is conveniently located, but it's also full of addictive substances. Nothing hates inconvenience more than addiction.\n\nSo maybe \"passive\" is a better watchword for what we're trying to change about the internet. After all, Erin Kissane wasn't talking about the importance of large networks of *passive* users consuming content. I think she was talking about the importance of maintaining a low bar for *engagement,* since the network she so valued was one of the most engaged collections of people on the internet ever. Also, I am not and have never been close to marketing, so I mean engagement as, like, you know, *engaging* with shit you care about. Not whatever else it ends up meaning.\n\nMastodon made it *convenient* for me to find this set of articles, but I had to actively engage with it to appreciate it.\n\nJason Becker says: \n\n *I am never going to get all of the people I’m connected to online to go back to using RSS. And I’m not going to get them to bookmark my webpage and visit it multiple times a day. They have places they consistently read feeds.*\n\n\nI don't think that's entirely true. I mean, no, not everyone. [Maybe not every post is for everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2vejhdm8lo&t=49s) But I only read his post because I checked, for the third time, the website of a guy who checked Jason's website. Maybe no one's going to find and check your website without a reason, but I'm going to click through if I actually care about it, or if the link looks interesting. This is called *browsing* and I miss it.\n\nI feel like all these conversations and calls to action I hear have this in common; they're calling for an active and critical engagement with the internet -- what we put on it, how we build it, and how we use it to connect with other people. For some people that means writing your own CMS from scratch and federating all your posts to multiple services. For others it might mean making a mutual aid Facebook group. Or maybe just starting a text thread with friends. \n\nThere's a sort of \"cat's out of the bag, what comes next?\" vibe to a lot of these conversations. I definitely don't have the answer, but I've really appreciated the questions and challenges posed by all the sources I've posted here. This is what I'm hearing:\n\n- We want to be able to connect, broadly\n- We want a humane speed.\n- We don't just want moderation, we want a kind of internet that *can be moderated.* We might just want moderate internet.\n- We have been convinced that you can't scale if you ask people to *do something* to get to content, rather than just lining up to receive it.\n- We have been convinced that stuff has to scale.\n\n \nErin Kissane is challenging us to do something that can empower mass numbers of people without having to *harvest* mass numbers of people. That's definitely tricky.\n\nBut if this is where the conversation is at, I'm excited to see what comes next and will try hard to contribute meaningfully to it.\n\nThank you XOXO for making this conversation feel vital, spirited, and friendly.\n\nps OMG I almost forgot. One of the great things that came out of this zeitgeist already was Molly White putting out a call for personal blogs in the afterglow of the festival on the XOXO slack and getting [this treasure trove](https://gist.github.com/molly/e5003cfed284baf075c01e9470c089bc) back. That's your present for getting this far. ❌🅾️❌🅾️\n\n[^1]: In likening the experience of using the internet in the 21st century to frogs in a pot of boiling water, I should point out that frogs, and all other creatures with enough sense not to invent social media, actually do jump out.

    "raw_markdown": "What does it mean for an image to be made by hand? In general usage, calling something handmade places a certain amount of care and responsibility with the maker. If you made a pie by hand you can take credit for its deliciousness. You wave off compliments if it's store-bought. But just as handmade pies lean on the qualities of their ingredients, even the most handmade of images are inseparable from the physical, non-human properties of the tools and materials that someone's hands used in the making. How much we let those properties matter in our reading of an image depends on where we locate the \"art\" of the process; i.e. where we expect the presence of an artist doing art in a way that matters to the image. \n\nIf a graphic artist today wants to reproduce the look of an early modern propaganda poster, they might seek out digital brushes that reproduce the fine grain of a lithograph crayon or a pastel. If we are to say that an image using real crayons or pastels is more handmade than that image, we locate some of the art in the physical materials themselves. If we say the digital image they make with those brushes is meaningfully more \"handmade\" than one made with \"AI\", then we locate the art more in the movement of the artist's hand than in the materials. \n\nThe advent of image generating systems and other things we call \"AI\" has made the question of what constitutes a handmade image feel urgent enough for artist and non-artists alike to start fighting online about it. I think the mainstreaming of digital painting tools, meant to simulate specific materials and gestures, warranted the widespread public negotiation we're now having, so I think we've got some catching up to do.  If we are going to come up with a useful distinction between types of physical authorship, focusing on the tools and materials is a dead-end, since we can shift where we locate the art to qualify or disqualify images as we like. We can never say the hand makes an image alone, because even handprints on a cave wall benefit from the assistance of indifferent, powerfully-pigmented material. Maybe we could look to sign language, martial arts, or saman (\"the dance of a thousand hands\"[^1]) to be absolutists about art of the hand, but how useful would that be to us in the gallery or the studio? \n\nOn the other hand (ha), there are plenty of handmade images that would rather you forget where they came from. Much of the training of graphic design before the digital age was in how to present an image to a viewer that remains an image, without any reminder of the process that put it there. Then digital tools were created to remove the hand from the image even further, replacing the designer's drafting table, Letraset sheets, and pots of gouache . But now \"AI\" image generators and processors threaten the jobs of photo retouchers and matte painters. If we are going to recognize the difference between the work of a photo retoucher using Adobe Photoshop before and after the addition of tools like \"Generative Fill,\" we must hunt for the presence of a human hand carefully and intentionally hidden by many layers of \"conventional\" automation.\n\nInstead of drawing and redrawing boundaries between human and computer, we could distinguish between images in general and images that, when we look at them, remind us that they were *made,* revealing to some degree how they were made and who made them. We could distinguish images based on the activity of the artist's thoughts, not their hands. Is it an image that a human thought about making, and, in doing so, did they think about how other humans will receive it? \n\nI think this distinction is much more important and useful than how the image was constructed because, as receivers -- not even *viewers* -- of images, we also make (and remake) images in our minds. This distinction also allows us to move towards a more inclusive term that doesn't assume everyone has the same kind of body.\n\n#### The entanglement of thought and seen images\n\nI listen to music, stare out the window, and nap in the studio because there is something *concretely* useful to me as a painter that comes out of the imagining -- or really, *imaging* that comes from music or dreams (day- or otherwise). It's not inspiration to paint, it's the same work[^2] as painting in a fundamental way. Not in every way, of course. I paint with oil paint because the physical qualities of the paint turn the process of making a picture with paint into a collaboration with material in a way that is significant to me and the pictures I make. The gap between imagination and the canvas may be massive and charged with electricity, but your mind is one of the contact points between which the creative spark sparks. Even if you have no idea what you're going to make before you pick up a brush and try to cross that gap, you produce mental images of some kind -- many kinds, really --  in tandem with the physical image. Whether you need paint, dirt, or pixels to create an image, we cannot deny the importance or the existence of the thought image, the medium-less image.\n\nThe types of handmade images that I am concerned with as a painter are the ones which requires their makers to remain aware, present, and curious about both kinds of images that constitute the life of a picture. Ones that can only be made with an understanding that pictures exist in an entanglement between thought images and images fixed in a medium.  I think this sort of image should be of equal concern to anyone interested in image generators or \"AI\" in general.\n\n The artist Vija Celmins declared a similar interest, in\n\n> ...that kind of double reality, where there's an image, but the image is here in another form, and when you look at the work, you have that double thing you should have all the time, where you're looking at the making. A kind of redescribing of the surface, and the image is interwoven with that surface.[^3]\n\n> I wanted... an image that was in your mind, that was vast, and the reality which was very restrained and flat and made, and that was actual.\"\n\n\nCelmins makes a particular type of hyper-realistic art which I wouldn't call photorealism, because it seems more concerned with the object than with the photograph. She makes sculptures of stones, drawings of the ocean, paintings of space. By referring to them as \"redescriptions,\" she implies that the object itself, before she found it or looked at it or drew it, was first described by its own existence. So it follows that art that re-describes it should be fully entangled with its existence, not simply its image, not just the light reflected off its surface.\n\nIf you go to art school, you enter a context where this is expected of pictures. You leave with a shorthand for it -- interesting pictures are \"rigorous\", or maybe \"serious\". They are interesting because when they come alive in your mind, they don't stop moving. They can't be pinned down, they feel like visitors you can talk to rather than artifacts that can be owned or consumed. \n\nIf you set about trying to make and understand images like this you can work on it for most of your life like Celmins has. But you will not be stuck in your mind, or in the picture, you will be firmly pressed against parts of the outside world, examining them and your experience of them to an exacting level of detail and depth.\n\n\nCelmins says: \n\n> There are millions of decisions of course when you're working on something, so I try to be alive and present for that moment. It's a kind of record of moments of attention.\n\nPictures that are \"made by hand\" in this way are the results of a process of mental imaging and picture making. The hands are often just a way of touching the world you are thinking of. We might be better off calling this kind of image \"mindmade\".\n\n\n\n\n## Ignoring the spirochetes\n\nIf this is the kind of art you want to have and to make, then it should be obvious that machines aren't close to making it any time soon. Computers got so good at making pictures so fast that we forgot -- or were encouraged to forget -- how bad they are at thinking about pictures. Machines do not look. We have been too ready to contribute our minds' images to breathe life into images with no mind behind them.\n\nIt's natural that we would look at a complex picture, and start asking questions about the amount and types of thought that went into making it. That's what being an art student or a \"rigorous\" artist is all about. I'd venture that it's somewhat less natural that, in doing so, we would center our conversations around technology, technologists, and the businesses and products they make. Talking about art, artfulness, and consciousness in these terms is ultimately pointless. It is a political act, akin to firing your AI ethicists[^4], to choose not to seriously engage the voices of all the many artists, writers, scientists, and non-technologist-thinkers that have been asking these same questions for much, much longer than the PR department at Google has. This is why I think we should meet these tools as art students, because otherwise we're just customers.\n\nI'm also hoping that, if we do, we will understand more deeply what's at stake in the attempt to make machines that could make art. Or rather, machines that could be art students with us. Right now, ChatGPT can pass the Bar, but it can't get an MFA. To graduate art school, it would have to show up, ask questions, keep showing up, keep asking questions, and make *something*, not even an image, that was intrinsically tied to that process. It would have to *be* in the world with us.\n\nPerhaps I keep laboring this point because I've only read one compelling description of an artificial intelligence that acted like that, and I think we should put more effort into imagining such a thing. It was in Lewis Thomas's essay  An Earnest Proposal[^5]and the AI he described ends up saving humans from destroying themselves, even though we asked it to launch nuclear missiles. \n\nLewis Thomas published *An Earnest Proposal* in response to the growing anxiety over automated computer systems all the way back in 1971. He addresses the logical concern that the \"practical men\" running our countries would enlist intelligent computers, if we had them, in the complex decisions of nuclear warfare, in deciding acceptable levels of \"megadeath\". Like today's AI alarmists, good or bad faith though they may be, Thomas wanted the deciders to slow down a little. \n\n> I have an earnest proposal to make. I suggest that we defer further action until we have acquired a really complete set of information concerning at least one living thing. Then, at least, we shall be able to claim that we know what we are doing. The delay might take a decade; let us say a decade. We and the other nations might set it as an objective of international, collaborative science to achieve a complete understanding of a single form of life. When this is done, and the information programmed into all our computers, I for one would be willing to take my chances.\n\nHe nominates Myxotricha paradoxa, a protazoa that lives in the digestive tract of Australian termites. \n\n> It is not as though we would be starting from scratch. We have a fair amount of information about this creature already -- not enough to understand him, of course, but enough to inform us that he means something, perhaps a great deal.\n\nIt turns out termites don't digest wood, Myxotricha paradoxa does it for them. It poops out lignin, which the termites then use to build their metropolises. Myxotricha uses flagellae to swim around inside termites in search of wood. But, oops, they're not flagellae, they're spirochetes -- which are also basically separate, living things. And -- oops again -- some organelles, which are actually their own bacteria again, live at the connection point between spirochete and Myxotricha. My knowledge of what they're doing there is stuck at 1971 pop-science levels which is \"probably contributing enzymes that break down the cellulose.\" The description, unsurprisingly, goes on and gets more complicated.\n\nSo, Thomas says, fine, build computers that tell us how and when to blow up the world. Just make sure they understand one single tiny part of it first. Thomas ends with this:\n\n> I take it on faith that computers, although lacking souls, are possessed of a kind of intelligence.

    "raw_markdown": "I have very strong, interconnected synesthesia. This makes categorization of really any kind rather *non-linear* for me. I'm glad to have avoided developing a *need* for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I'm always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don't even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They're a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.\n\n## Language has a direction, but ideas have many\n\n\nGalaxy brain is not what you're supposed to do for writing, because sentences go in one direction and galaxy is all directions. But the difference between writing essays for humans and writing code for computers is that humans are [lossy compilers](https://mmmx.cloud/lossy-compiler). We do not interpret every word and every idea as replicable tokens with fixed meanings. There's a give to syntax, and meaningful writing, even with its many carefully chosen words and arranged thoughts, will spawn countless and unpredictable new thoughts in its readers. I've always felt like this winds up some tension at the heart of language -- words help us drill down and get specific, but they also rebound outward at incredible speed, colliding with new words and ideas on their arc.\n\nSeems like since writing began, we've experimented with ways to resolve this tension. Ways to fix ideas in writing but keep them mobile. The internet is maybe the biggest experiment in that tradition ever, animating text like never before with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks say \"this text is related to this other text.\" Hashtags are interesting because they say \"this text *might* be related to some other text that might or might not exist yet.\" They are inherently speculative and interconnected. It's always a little exciting to click on a hashtag with no other results.\n\nAs a lossy compiler who likes to galaxy brain, this feels correct to me. Often when I begin writing about one thing, it becomes enough about another thing that I am suddenly writing two things. That can happen at any scale, because most things are other things too.\n\n\n### How do you write in all directions at once?\n\nTo some degree this is just part of what makes good writing hard. From all the delicious words and wonderful ideas, you have to choose just a few darlings to let onto the page. But sometimes that friction is too much for me and I never get there. I've made attempts to blog for maybe 20 years, but they never stick, and I think it's because blogs go in one direction, and everything is only one thing: a post. After all this time, I finally found a way to do it, mostly thanks to the ideas of digital gardening.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean, though? At this point in time I don't think there's a defined orthodoxy of Digital Gardening Concepts, so like most people who've tried this, I cherry-picked the ones that worked best for me. These were:\n\n- post in-progress or incomplete things and return to them as you wish\n- use backlinks -- bidirectional links that show you how things are related to each other\n- make it easy to create wandering, criss-crossing paths of related texts and posts\n- write as if the computers will take care of your memories\n- link to things even if they're not there yet\n- honorable mention: in-place previews of linked texts. Not 100% crucial for me and not currently implemented, but planned\n\n\nHonestly, it might be the other way around, that these concepts led to the idea of Digital Gardens. Right now, thinking about this threatens to become Another Essay Thing, because the well of ideas one would need to dip into to distinguish between mainstream hypertext history, the recent [digital-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) / tools-for-thought movement, and theories of dense hypermedia is *[d](https://nikolas.ws/rhizomic-software-architecture/) [e](https://doriantaylor.com/summer-of-protocols/) [e](https://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/) [p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).* I'd love to jump in (of course) but let's just throw some hyperlinks into the last sentence and move on. \n\nAnyway, I finally solved my How to Post Regularly problem by building my own version of a [memex](https://www.mmmx.cloud/). You can read an incomplete accout of how I built it [here](https://www.mmmx.cloud/how-this-memex-started/), but generally the ideas above were what made the difference for me. Digital gardening is a nice term that I return to, because with gardening things don't have to be complete, or ordered, or discrete, and you return to cultivate it. (Of course there are  [other definitions too.](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406))\n\nAfter a decade of feeling unsatisfied and destabilized in my relationship to reading and writing on the internet, the last year of having my memex up and running has been the most enjoyable, honest, and consistent year of personal internet usage for me since I was churning out [Dreamweaver messes](https://web.archive.org/web/20010220191148/http://www.nimweb.net/) late at night in my early 20s. Even at the start, I was struck by how a few simple patterns could support a fundamental shift in my expectations of reading and writing the internet. It feels more than ever like a tool I can hold and use. That's because it's small enough for me to hold and put down, it's simple and pretty durable, and it applies to things in my life beyond the time I spend on the screen.\n#### An Example of Galaxy-writing\n\nI wanted to do the proper thing you're supposed to do with a digital garden thing and make a note about an [interesting book](https://www.mmmx.cloud/patterns-of-intention/). But the way I got that book was interesting, and in writing about it I had a chance to name that [way of finding things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/slow-motion-bullseyes/). And I had to make a note for the bookstore [where I found it](https://www.mmmx.cloud/mother-foucault-s/). Since then, a lot more has happened at that bookstore that I want to write about, but there's no implied structural expectation, like a dated entry in a blog, *because there's no implied structure.* Things are just related to other things, and sometimes you can put [labels on a kind of thing.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/tag/mind-things/)\n\n#### Where are the Hashtags\n\nNow you may notice that none of those pages have hashtags. Most of their relationships are via *backlinks.* But hashags *are* backlinks, just with an intermediary page. When they're not hemmed in by a single platform, you don't even need the page in the middle, as we've shown with the web component implementation of Octothorpes, like this one <octo-thorpe>why-we-made-octothorpes</octo-thorpe>. \n\nThats why Octothorpes treats backlinks and hashtags as equal, first-order entities. They are remarkably similar concepts underneath. Since some of the pages on my Memex are dynamic collections of things, a backlink to one works much like  hashtag. And when I galaxy brain while writing, and want to make a link to something I have in mind but haven't written yet, I can backlink to the title I'll probably give to it, waiting for it to be filled in once the page exists. Just like the aspirational hashtag, hoping for new posts to give it meaning.\n\nSo it doesn't really matter what we call them -- the thing that made the difference for me was having these types of links that build networks of association that are easy to navigate. That last part is cruicial. Bi-directional relationships and open-ended, linked labels let readers -- and writers -- chart their own paths through meaningfully related ideas. \n\nBut why should those meaningful relationships of ideas stop at the edge of *my* website (or my app or my platform) especially when friends are writing about [related things](https://www.mmmx.cloud/burglars-guide) ? What's the point of galaxy braining if you're alone in the galaxy?\n\nSo, in that way, we made Octothorpes to galaxy brain with friends.\n",

The rest of the details escape me!\n\n<br>\n\n\n![A drawing of a modified bicycle made called a rikimbili](/assets/notes/rikimbili.jpeg)\nThis is a _rikimbili_ -- one of the ubiquitous yet illegal motorized bicycle conversions in Cuba that form a unique part of the ad-hoc infrastructure of goods and services that run the island nation's economy.\n\n\nThis Rikimbili\n---------------------------------\n1. Repurposed plastic crate used for food and supply delivery\n2. Gravity fed gas tank, mounted with a strap tied through the crate\n3. Handle for engaging the direct-drive transmission, which consists of pressing the motor's driveshaft to the back wheel.\n4. Handmade second seat, likely out of palm wood. These seats are very common on all types of bicycles in Cuba. Note the foot pegs to accommodate children.\n5. Modern, ergonomic handlebars.\n6. The entire rear section had been rebuilt to make it possible to replace the back wheel with a motorcycle wheel.\n7. Handmade kickstand, welded and bolted from scrap metal.\n8. Brand new Chinese made LED headlamp\n9. Handmade shock absorbers.\n\nThis one was seen delivering food and supplies to a state-licensed tourist stop on the bus line between Havana and Cienfuegos. Though easier to spot within urban areas, one can still see rikimbilis transporting goods and passengers past the ever-present groups of commuters and travelers waiting in semi-official clusters on the side of the highway to catch a ride with any willing vehicle, whether it's a tour bus or vintage taxi. The sounds of their unmuffled engines highlight gaps in transportation and urban planning and exemplify the hustle and ingenuity that Cuban citizens wield in the face of shortages, restrictions, and poverty. \n\nThe design and use of the rikimbili is irrevocably tied to the unique material, political, and economic circumstances in Cuba. Though travel to the state has been legal for US citizens since 2015, (update: not anymore) the US's controversial trade embargo remains in place. While the terms and history of the embargo are complex, but it has had an undeniable impact on daily life in Cuba. However, there are many more factors that have placed Cuba's supply chain and economy in an ongoing state of crisis. Given the state's enormous amount of control over the use and allocation of resources (and who has access to information about those decisions), government management can't be discounted as a factor in Cuba's economic issues in the last 50 years, even if the results can't be clearly separated from the effects of foreign policy. However, there is no question that the fall of the Soviet Union was one of the most important contributing factors to Cuba's current material circumstances. Trade agreements with the USSR had supplied the vast majority of consumer and industrial goods, as well as a significant amount of fuel and agricultural products. The abrupt dissolution of these agreements led to a period of economic constraint so severe, the government gave it an official, if euphemistic, name -- \"The Special Period in Time of Peace\".  That period is over, and things are changing fast in Cuba, but current conditions are still heavily shaped by these historical forces.\n\nIn the absence of a functional supply chain, Cuban citizens have created a sort of social supply chain with its own set of standard practices and products, developed by tinkerers, engineers, and regular people over decades. During _Período especial_, the government recognized that conditions would require resourcefulness and released _The Book for the Family_. The now-classic book compiled international publications, including Popular Mechanics, featuring instructions for repairing home electronics, some medical reference, a guide to phytotherapy with indigenous plants, and instructions for improvising weapons. This was, in part, a condensation of knowledge from the military's preparations for an American invasion that never came. Two years later, they released a second book to share the innovations that Cuban citizens had produced -- [_Con Nuestros Propios Esfuerzos_](http://cubamaterial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Con-Nuestros-Propios-Esfuerzos-reduced.pdf) (\"With Our Own Efforts\"). Among its many recipes and products that spread throughout the Cuban design community, one of the most infamous was a recipe for turning grapefruit rind into a kind of steak.\n\nThese books were a formal recognition of the DIY culture of distribution, production, and maintenance that Cuban citizens developed to get through their daily lives. Products like [chargers to restore single-use hearing aid batteries and gravity-powered engine starters](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/bizarre-brilliant-useful-inventions-cuban-diy-engineers/) are deeply integrated with the social fabric that requires, produces, and uses them. [According to illustrator Edel Rodriguez](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/isolation-generation-master-inventors-cuba/), \"Everything has to be hustled by connection, by someone you know or farmers. And most of it can’t be had by legal means.” This is a community design culture, driven by necessity, which disregards not just legal limitations but the very definitions of the products they work with.\n\nWhile researching for his [book](http://www.ernestooroza.com/rikimbili-une-etude-sur-la-desobeissance-technologique-et-quelques-formes-de-reinvention-2009/) on rikimbilis, Cuban artist and designer Ernesto Oroza coined the term \"technological disobedience\" to summarize \"how Cubans acted in relation to technology.\" He says they surpass not just the limits of their controlled economy, but the \"authority\" held by contemporary, manufactured objects. Oroza saw the emergence of the rikimbili as a socially designed object \"like a milestone in the technical knowledge of Cubans during the crisis... and it represented many ideas. Especially the audacity to confront very complex technology and to risk one's life by using a potentially lethal object.\"  \n\n[Oroza appears in a short documentary about his collection of Cuban inventions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-XS4aueDUg)\t\n\nHis body of work and the concept of technological disobedience provide a rich lens through which to ask the questions of how design serves the needs of its intended audience, and the forms that a community's response to crisis or pressure can take.\n\nFor example, community response to failing infrastructure in American cities like Detroit can be seen as further expressions of technological disobedience. When the bureaucratically-paralyzed water authority engaged in mass shutoffs of residential water, locals who could access or make [water keys](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/detroit-water-shutoff-life-or-death) emerged as a new (paid) service in neighborhoods without water. While illegal, it can be seen as a legitimate response when institutions like golf courses kept their access to water despite owing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and when many accounts couldn't be confirmed or tracked down to reinstate access once paid. The mass shutoffs were seen as a failure of oversight, not simply the inevitable result of private citizens failing to pay their bills. Similarly, there have been [multiple](http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/195546856-story) [projects](http://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/9092/hip_bus_stop_benches_built_from_demolished_houses#.WNlFcxIrLMW) by private citizens to create bus shelters or benches in response to the conditions of Detroit's notoriously inadequate public transit system. The [official response](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/05/02/detroit-puts-brakes-on-bus-stop-benches/2131295/) has not always been favorable, but solutions have yet to arrive through approved channels. As the material culture in Cuba demonstrates, communities will fill the gaps left by failing governance and infrastructure if pressed hard enough.\n\n\n",

    "raw_markdown": "![An oil pastel drawing hung on a wall depicting a shortened figure in seventeenth century Dutch fashion with two red-stockinged legs sticking out from the bottom of the collar of a darkened face blending into a large, spade-shaped hat, smoking a Gouda pipe.](/assets/notes/warpaint-no-1.jpeg)\n> Warpaint no. 1, Oil pastel on paper, 2023\n> \n\nThis picture samples paintings about being at war, being a painter, and being a drunk. I plan to make more like it, and I ended up making it because I was led to it by a painting that samples paintings about death and revelry and imagined lands that I'm still working on. Immediately after finishing this picture, I started making drawings based on prepatory sketches for historical paintings and prints about apocalypse, madness, war, piousness, and dentistry.\n\nThe left foot in this painting comes from one of the strangest and most unpleasant paintings I know of,  [Soldiers Plundering a Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx#/media/File:Vrancx_Soldiers_Plundering.jpg) by [Sebastiaen Vrancx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx), who was both an unremarkable soldier and an important painter. \n\n![A 17th century painting by Sebastiaen Vrancx called soldiers plundering a farm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Vrancx_Soldiers_Plundering.jpg)\n\n\nCertainly part of the reason it feels that way is because of how long I have looked at it, but you have to do that this painting. The strangeness reveals itself over time because so much is unintentional, accumulated, or sublimated.\n\n\nThe painting, was made to have a *very* legible meaning. That you would look at it and see the villany of the soldiers as they maurauded the countryside under the lightest pretense that, at some point, they would fight in the war they were hired to fight, hopefully on the right side. Among the miliary scenes of Sebastiaen Vrancx,  this painting stands out in its scale and plot. Rather than depicting the grand sweep of an important battle between consequential generals, we have an anonymous farmhouse belonging to civilians, possibly citizens of the same empires as some of the soldestka happily slaughtering them. And everyone looks more like a cartoon than anything in Vrancx's paintings of war. It's closer to his genre work, of daily life or allegorical scenes. The tendency of classical Dutch painters to depict humans as puglike wads of bleached flesh has always fascinated and disguested me. It's like they are simultaneously criticizing humans for committing the crime of being alive and apologizing for their own complicity.\n\nThis painting is a sitcom. Look at the set framing and even the lighting. Dutch painters at this time, including Vrancx, were *very* aware of optical perspective, but applied its rules selectively. This has none of the excruciating \"accuracy\" of a still life filled with the spoils of empire. Narrative distorted the lens, placed characters in explicable rather than physical space, removed the fourth wall of the set so the audience can see everyone doing all the significant things, wearing all the signifying articles of clothing. \n\nThis painting is a cartoon. The colors, the edges, the level of detail. These are images to illustrate action. But for someone like Vrancx, a cartoon was a prepartory sketch, a diagram describing who goes where and what the edges of things are. To be more than that, to be a painting, he had to at least gesture at the incidental details of \"realism\" (a nonexistent term in the 1660s). The dull metallic sheen of the central soldier's helmet, the logs of firewood stashed away in the rafters. Perhaps the model for the man about to be struck down was a local farmer Vrancx broke bread with. Maybe he was someone he killed or watched die during his time as a soldier, maybe he was made up from Vrancx's own latent mental space of Dutch faces.\n\nThere's so much wrong and weird with this painting, but it still works. This happened, this is happening, this will happen again. How hard do we need to squint to see the official narrative, that to be a soldier means this or that, that war is necessary? How long can we hold one eye shut with that in mind until we let go and just see a bunch of young unattached men with weapons, killing and plundering people who don't have them because they were busy raising crops and children?\n\nAnd maybe it -- the attempt to communicate horror -- works better because it's so blobby and awkward? I have no idea how this appears to a normal person -- I'm at the point where the bawling toddler bawling, alone in the middle of incomprehensible chaos, has become my a  reaction meme in my own mind for various tragedies, big and small.\n\nBut I *think* the ugliness is part of what makes it work. The unfathomable unsexiness of it. The visual bluntness of the weapons, the soldier's dark robes outlined as if being explained to a child. And, as modern viewers, all of that just runs headlong into the vague, historically freighted sense of this as old valuable \"art\". It's a Dutch painting by a famous painter from the 17th Century! How much more *art* can you get than that? We have to undress it, strip the period costumes and ineffably-specific aesthetic turns, and imagine that it once was a window into a way that humans lived, perhaps a very smudged one, but a window still. From our distance the whole aesthetic of its era blurs together, but if you're looking at at the calm, well-lit rooms of Vermeer or the precise hedonism of Weenix, and you remember this painting, the toddler's wail breaks the refined mood like a siren in the distance.\n\nSpeaking of Vermeer, that's the back leg. Vermeer's (likely) actual use of actual optics gives *his* orange stocking not just a sublime luminosity, but also, you know, the shape of a human leg. And I say it's his because it's not just from his painting, but because it's his own painting of his own leg in [The Art of Painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Painting). \n\n[![The Art of Painting by Jan Vermeer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/909px-Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg#/media/File:Jan_Vermeer_-_The_Art_of_Painting_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\")\n\n\n\nThe domestic scene that painting depicts is about as far from the plundered farmhouse as you can get, conceptually, without leaving the Dutch \"golden age\" entirely. I wonder whose stocking cost more, and who paid for the one the soldier is wearing.\n\nAnd speaking of wailing toddlers, the black hat, pipe, hair, and ghost face are from Jan Steen. Specifically his painting, [As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_Old_Sing%2C_So_Pipe_the_Young_(Jan_Steen)), and specifically the [earlier, smaller version](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/169-as-the-old-sing-so-pipe-the-young/). \n\n[![As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young, preliminary version](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/media/rixlq4ed/169_repro.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=3230&rnd=132629839593400000&quality=70)](https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/169-as-the-old-sing-so-pipe-the-young/)\n\n\nThere's another toddler in this milieu, swabbing up life-shaping trauma like his playmate in the farmhouse, but having a lot more fun as he does. He's part of the \"young\" of the title -- the impressionable youth, at risk from the merriment of the adults. Steen had a grand career of painting, with deep and experienced relish, rooms full of lowlifes having an excellent time doing everything they aren't supposed to, usually putting himself right in the middle. His paintings are kind of anti-still-lives. Some nice objects that signify material wealth are getting absolutely thrashed in this very painting. Vrancx's people look messed up, but like Vrancx was still trying. When Steen exaggerates a subject's features for some lost aesthetic meaning, they look like a goddamn alien. He painted  -- and one would assume got paid for -- an aspirational [interior scene of the family Gerrit Schouten](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Steen_-_Fantasy_Interior_with_Jan_Steen_and_the_Family_of_Gerrit_Schouten_-_Google_Art_ProjectFXD.jpg), the owner of the Elephant brewery, in which his daughters are so willowy they look like praying mantises in period dress. I often wonder how he was ever sober enough to paint. \n\nGenerally, I'm averse to direct connections between the historical \"meaning\" of the paintings I'm looking at and the paintings I make because the temptation of \"getting\" it encourages you to look past the distortions. If any my paintings had a \"point,\" it would be what's wrong with them when you compare them to the paintings they look like, not what's \"right.\" There's an engagement with paint-as-paint in still lives of this era that's startlingly contemporary once you see it. Genre paintings, like the ones this picture has snipped pieces from, get distracted by plot and character. We can go from Vrancx to Vermeer to see the scope of how much *seeing* was considered important on the grand stage of life. And then, honking out an armpit fart version of  [*Het Wilhelmus*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwBrR_G70RE), here comes Steen, the drunken master with his own 4 a.m. wisdom.\n\nDigging into these sitcom-cartoon-allegories full of fleshy, awkward people has built a dim, drafty theater in my mind. I'm sitting in the back of it, watching a play of manners in a language I don't understand. Sometimes the sun will break through the window so realistically I feel the warmth and am suddenly aware of exactly how ripe the pears on the table are, the number of strands of hair out of place in the lead actress's complex hairstyle. Sometimes soldiers or disease tear through and kill half the cast, and I can't tell if the blood is real. The smell of old beer certainly is.\n\nI don't understand how Steen, Vermeer, and Vrancx's scenes all existed at the same time as part of the same way of life, just like I don't understand exactly how to fit life as a painter into the world we currently have.

    "raw_markdown": "Part of me wants to talk about how fun the internet was when it was *just* websites. But we barely had tags then, let alone hashtags. Much like the \"Y2K Garage Sale\" that happened down the street from me, any nostalgia I have for that time is selective memory indelibly colored by all the work that we did to improve things since the early 2000s. I remember enjoying *reading* the internet much more back then, but *writing* it felt much worse.\n\nIt might be snappier to say that this project came out of \"a love for the way the web used to be\" or something like that, but that's not quite it. People are making [beautiful](https://www.spencerchang.me/window/), [compelling](https://pearsproject.org/) [work](https://oral.pub/) on the internet maybe [more than ever](https://diagram.website/). I feel like I've found some of my favorite projects *this year.* *So why does using internet feel like being trapped in a garbage dump most of the time??*\n\nTrying to answer this question is *definitely* part of what led to Octothorpes, if indirectly.\n\nBesides the obvious answers, primary among them that huge monopolies have tried very hard to make it this way, I have two theories that have been driving me.\n\n## First Theory: Our expectations of the internet have been colonized\n\nWhen I think of the experience of reading the internet that I miss, I realize it had a lot in common with reading zines, which were also a much bigger part of my life then. A certain lack of professionalism in content *and* delivery was to be expected. There were some memes, but most sites had a distinct personal voice, and it was also a *reading* experience more than it was a *scrolling* experience. \n\nThe high-water-mark for me was having a daily web-comic reading ritual. I could have subscribed to their RSS feeds, but I had a [sequence](https://www.dieselsweeties.com/) [I](https://www.wigucomics.com/oc/index.php?comic=1538) [liked](https://scarygoround.com/index.html) [to](http://drmcninja.com) [read](https://achewood.com/) them in and I could go from one to the next by clicking the \"other good comics\" links in their footers. I'm just now realizing that maybe the best part of this ritual was that after it, I would *leave my computer and go do other things for the rest of the day.* 🤔\n\nAfter Web 1.0, we drifted away from the idea that you could usually read *all* or most of something you liked on the internet. When you did, sometimes it was hard to find more. Crucially you often had to *look for* the good stuff -- it wasn't just piped into your brain endlessly. Recommendations came from people, both friends or the authors of the material you were reading. All of this became an anathema when we shifted gears up to Web 2.0 on the infobahn.\n\nThe best articulation of that shift that I've read is [The Garden and the Stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/). A garden is something you return to, either to tend or enjoy, while a stream rushes by forever. This is [one of](https://youtu.be/XQLdhVpLBVE?si=KBErRk-q0sUWPCuq&t=406) the originating points of the concept of \"[digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)\"  and I was among the people moved by it to make one. In fact I went deeper to turn it into a [memex](https://mmmx.cloud) of sorts.\n\nThere are so may things we used to assume about putting things on the internet that quietly slipped away in the shift from the garden to the stream. This list can also be called \"Things That Are Not True About Instagram.\" Some of these things are true about some of the big sites, less so when you use their app, but I wonder for how long.\n\n## Things we assumed about the internet during Web 1.0\n\n- If you want to put some thing on the internet, you put them on websites\n- You have to Go Online to see websites.\n- This means you can Go Offline\n- Web pages had URLs\n- Web pages loaded, and then you had a web page\n- \"Having\" a website means, mostly, owning a website and the things on it\n- You can open larger versions of scaled images\n- If you post something, it's not going to disapper on its own unless you delete it\n- You can copy text\n- You can click on all links\n- You can download things you want to save\n- Websites don't make your phone ding or vibrate\n- No one is remotely monitoring your browsing activity\n- You don't scroll to discover things, you browse or \"surf\"\n- Recommendations come from people\n- Scrolling ends\n\nI miss all of these. However, these things I don't miss:\n\n- Posting takes significant effort, money, and special knowledge\n- Email or messy comment sections are the only way to connect with people posting stuff you liked\n- Accessibility was nonexistent\n- Links rot and standards change quickly\n- Other than StumbleUpon, most connections are manually maintained (webrings, link lists, blogrolls)\n- A lot of people didn't feel welcome or like they could find people to connect with\n\nAnd of course, some of these are often still the case.\n\nThis isn't a unique -- or complete -- list of values for an open internet. A lot of people are thinking about this. The [Manifesto for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/) is a great start towards that list of values, and almost everything else I'd link to is in their \"further reading\" or \"references\" section. \n\nMy list is just what I try to remind myself about the discomfort I feel with the way it feels to post on the Internet of Today. That it's not inevitable or necessary to give up the things on the first list to change the things on the second. I think we've just been upsold and enshittified into living on processed [slop](https://www.garbageday.email/p/slop-void) when we actually have better tools than ever to go out and garden for ourselves. \n\nSo that's one reason we're building Octothorpes -- to make it easier to have an internet like the first list without the stuff on the second list.\n\nPart two: [[We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet]]",

    "raw_markdown": "![Screenshot from the webcomic Achewood showing Ray Smuckles, the cat, sending chat messages to his best friend Roast Beef using a custom chat app that Beef made called Ray_and_Beef_Chat 8.0](/assets/texts/ray-beef-chat.png)\n\nThis is my ideal DM experience. The `8.0` indicates so much *care.* (To be clear, entirely on Beef's part.)\n\n_(This is part two of [[We Really Like Personal Sites But the Internet Has Been Turning into Poisonous Garbage At An Alarming Rate]])_\n\nI have a rule on my phone, and it has always been this way. Only humans are allowed to make my phone ask for my attention. And only recently have I appreciated what horrors it has saved me from. The notifications I currently get are:\n\n- texts from humans (incl signal and whatsapp)\n- direct mentions or messages on slack or mastodon\n- ...uhh that's it\n\nI don't even get notifications from the private discord I host for my friends (I would but it seems broken and who am I to argue with it). I certainly don't get notifications from Instagram, even for DMs, for the same reason that if a friend wants to talk to me in a crowded bus station I will suggest we go outside first.\n\n## Notifications should come from People Not Apps\n\nPeople, not apps, deserve my spontaneous attention. I'm not going to explain why. I don't think I'm smart or special for doing it this way. I'm still waiting for someone to explain why it should be any other way. When I see a push notification for ᴄʜɪᴘᴏᴛʟᴇ x ᴊᴏᴊᴏ ꜱɪᴡᴀ ɪꜱ ᴄᴜʀʀᴇɴᴛʟʏ ʟɪᴠᴇ ᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴀʟʟɢʀᴇᴇɴꜱ ᴇxᴘᴇʀɪᴇɴᴄᴇ appear on a friend's phone, I feel the same concern and desire to throw away their personal property that I would as if I found a tupperware labeled \"Fentanyl for later\" in their fridge. This comes from the same feral sense that makes us occasionally want to throw our phones in a lake.\n\nI'm not alone in trying to unpack what that feral sense needs. I think it's one of our few guideposts in the era of talking to the internet. Unlike my list of how the internet used to be, we don't really have a primordial era of notifications. We had email, chat rooms, text, and then smartphones and Facebook threw the sluice gates open. It's harder to parse which expectations for the social internet are sustainable and which are toxic, because they developed -- and are still developing -- largely in tandem with the ideas of the huge corporations that shoved social media into existence.\n\n\n### But also we want this\n\nThe biggest thing missing from my \"back in my day\" list was socializing. As in *socializing on* the internet, as opposed to \"because I got invited to something through the internet.\" One could argue that this was better, but one would be arguing with a rising sea. And of course the line between our online and irl social lives has been blurred beyond notice for years now. And we all have had real, treasured, human experiences that were only possible because of the internet. My late friend Corby had chronic health issues which often limited his mobility, and when he was stuck inside one of the things he'd do was post long, branching stories to a forum his friends ran. I treasure those stories now that he's gone. (There was also a webcomic.)\n\nI try to remember that the social internet is still relatively new, weird, and unfinished, because that means *we're still deciding what it can be.* And regular people have as much of a share in that \"we\" as the massive corporations do. Hashtags on Twitter happened because users started using them before official adoption. [A03 basically made tags a turing complete language](https://www.mmmx.cloud/fan-is-a-tool-using-animal/).\n\nI admire when people can do that, just say \"[idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.](https://joinreboot.org/p/folk-programmers)\"  [It's a foundational principle of the internet](https://www.mmmx.cloud/a-group-is-its-own-worst-enemy/). Without realizing it, I think I left that audacity in the land of websites, and fell in line with the social internet more than I wanted to.\n\nThere were two moments I can actually identify that woke me up to the idea that *I could have expectations* of social media and take some agency in how I use it. It reminded me that what we think of as social media is really just some ways of doing things on top of the basic fact that people can talk to each other through the internet. Basically that *it doesn't have to be this way.*\n\n### Awakening #1: Darius Kazemi's Run Your Own Social\n\nReading just the *headlines* of [this excellent guide](https://runyourown.social/) is enough to crack the shackles of Big Social from your mind. There is a direct line between me reading  *[You get to make the social rules and policies](https://runyourown.social/#you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies)* if you make your own social network and me starting up a private forum called Paddleboat for my friends at the beginning of the pandemic that became a loved and comfortable online space for some of us during those scary early days. When interest flagged below the $30-a-month-feels-ok-to-me level, we moved to Discord instead, called it Rollerblade, and now it's still going strong. It even got a shoutout in my friend [Ezra's newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies/archive/long-covid-studies-the-origin-story/).\n### Awakening #2: Ezra's favorite social network\n\nSpeaking of Ezra, five or six years ago, I was probably griping about Facebook, and Ezra said, offhand, that his favorite social network is just group texts. And that he had multiple ongoing ones with different themes. Shortly after that we started one with our friend Clare named, for obscure reasons, `Chubswombat` which uses the Tubthumper album art as an avatar, for obvious reasons. It is still going.\n\nI have always admired how remarkably good Ezra is at connecting with people online and with talking to people about his ideas in general. (He's recently been using his powers to push forward Long Covid action, despite Long Covid's efforts to stop him, and you should [subscribe to his newsletter](https://buttondown.email/longcovidstudies#subscribe-form) and call your local representatives.)\n\nThe wisdom of this statement helped get and keep me off Facebook at the start of lockdown and reminded me how effortless and fun it can be to \"post\" with friends. We paid for our phones and service, why do we need to see ads to talk to each other? Since then I have enjoyed group threads including but not limited to:\n\n- A yearslong round of [The RV Game](https://www.martenstuffer.com/anal-rvs)\n- The Castle of Friendship\n- All logistics for the DnD group I run, grouptext having defeated every other platform we attempted to use\n- Weird chips\n- Catsitting in my building\n- My niece's \"youtube channel\" which is just her making videos on her mom's phone and then her mom sending it to me and my wife and us \"liking\" and \"subscribing\"\n- Photos of the Kaiser Permanente building in Portland\n- Emoji notifications when one of two of my friends is peeing. (This started because one walked in on the other in the bathroom like a decade ago. Not sure how I got added.)\n- Videos a friend has been making with a wig she drags on a string like a pet\n\nMy favorite part of getting a smartphone was sending and getting pictures of works in progress with fellow painters. My favorite part of Instagram is seeing other painters' paintings and three group DMs I am in. _Maybe we don't actually need the rest of Instagram._ (**Maybe** the non-linkable, non-zoomable, non-text-copy-able _automatically disappearing_ portion of a closed surveillence advertising platform is *not* the ideal place to share logistical information about local grassroots cultural events but *what do I know.*)\n\n\n## What this means to me\n\nI think the values laid out in Run Your Own Social get pretty far towards a set of values for a social internet. And I think we're still pretty far from a world where it's easy to find platforms that embody them. I also think...we won't because... maybe... not? platforms? at all?\n\nMaybe the meta-value for whatever comes next is just this:\n\n## Social Networks Should Meet You Where You Already Are\n\nIf you try to make a new social network, the biggest obstacle is getting people to stop using the one where all their friends already are and use yours. So it can feel like TikTok or Instagram or Facebook are where people already are. This is true in a way. But the number of other people we can really connect with and keep track of is too small for big platforms to make money off our activity. So they have to train individuals to act like businesses or famous people. They teach us to talk like we're broadcasting while being told we're among friends. When we flee that pressure, we make themed chats, local groups, events, memes. That's where we actually are as *people* instead of *users*. \n\nThe platforms are the biggest, stinkiest bus stations imaginable. The scale of activity is thrilling, the access they provide has become important infrastructure, but the people that try to talk to the whole bus station at once are either hucksters, potentially violent, shills, or otherwise sketchy. We *avoid* those conversations and find small spaces where we can talk to each other. We are sharing a booth with some friends, or sitting on a bench with a few strangers, waiting to go to the same place. We want to talk to people, not platforms.\n\n\n## Our part in this\n\nI've never really articulated it to this level of detail, but some feral sense beneath the discomfort of having to go to the world's biggest stinkiest bus station just to share a booth with some friends and talk about paintings is how I got thinking about free-floating hashtags on a 15 mile day in Canyonlands (and possibly to distract from our inadequate water supply). My initial spec was very document-based, because documents were where I already was. (If you ever work with nonprofits or the government, you'll know that's where a lot of people still are.) I want a little Nim_and_Nik_Chat 8.0 magically integrated with this markdown document, and I want it to be easy for other people to have their version of that too. I love that as soon as I put this online and octothorpe it, Nik will get an email. I love that it will automatically show up in my list of essays on [a blog post I made on another website.](https://ideastore.dev/blog/why-tho/). I love that I don't know where else it will show up in the future.\n\nBut in the end it doesn't matter where you start -- the idea is that, wherever you already are, if you can't connect to your friends *and have a good conversation*, we'd like to make something that makes that possible. This is crucially different than \"wherever you are, you should be able to shout at the whole bus station at once.\" I also hope it will be crucially different than \"we just made another bus station with fewer people and weird rules.\" That will depend on how good Octothorpes is at letting people say \"idk what you want me to do, but i'mgonna do this instead.\"",

    "raw_markdown": "- last year's thing\n- why\n- this year's thing\n\t- more cards\n\t- more cards coming off the board\n\t- backlogs that are backlogs, not crammed inboxes\n- maybe something on being behind\n\n## 2023's thing\n\nI did a major review / overhaul of how I was working on projects across the board in winter / spring (mud season?) last year, both out of necessity and a conscious decision to try to find some footing after a year full of big shifts and changes. I was just calling it Get Set Up. That period lasted longer than I thought it would because we had to move art studios after ours got broken into multiple times in the spring, shortly after I thought I had finished my Getting Set Up. Besides all that, and partially because of it, I was in a strange and uncomfortable state with most of my projects. Like many people, my career momentum got disrupted at the start of the pandemic, but I managed to finish a few major projects in 2021/2022. But then everything got busy and chaotic and that was also most of the juice I had in me at the time, it seemed. So 2023's goal was to get all the plates spinning again, settle in to new habits and spaces and make sense of / clear out the remaining projects I had carried over from 2022/2023.\n\nMy most visible way of doing that was to put up a corkboard -- three small corkboards actually -- to track high-er level goals through out the year across various types of work. I wrote them on blue index cards and gave myself gold stars for working on them when I remembered to.\n\nThis is definitely more formal than I usual work, especially since it covered my art and music practices, but I felt like I needed it.\n\nOverall, I have to admit that it was pretty effective, in a way that didn't feel like too much extra work, even though it does feel a little... intense? dorky? not sure. Even so, I'm on board to keep it going, but I want to improve it for this year.\n\n## New flow for 2024\n\n### Vibes to improve\n\n- I got enough plates spinning that my head started to spin a little too. \n- Starting energy is different than continuing energy, and I need to make the shift. \n- Also, I'm working in multiple tracks that are the kind of thing that any one of them are deep enough for people to dedicate all of their time and energy to. Trying to do hard things in each can create some accumulating brain strain. There are healthier ways of recognizing and accepting this that I'd like to keep in front of me.\n- I'm not working at the same level across the board, so I'm also trying to balance my time and attention between what really deserves it and what just seems fun and cool at the moment.\n- I'm feeling too old to just be fuckin around on stuff. I spent most of my 30s cooking some big projects, and I'd like them to get out there.\n\n\n\n\nNew flow:\n\nput do-able goals cards on right hand corkboard at start of week\n\nassign yourself time to work on them during the week\n\ninbox only for short term goals\n\nin-flight needs a rethink, specific duration maybe\n\neverything else is a project backlog\n\nyou should be doing more concrete context switching, driven by goals or immediate tasks. ie looking at a card or a short term task, and then opening the project to see specifics, closing it when you move on to something else.",

He wanted to keep getting funding, but he didn't want people to bug him too much while he worked on it. So he picked a deliberately boring name, and put, I believe \"dynamic\" in the name because he knew bureaucrats liked it. Cna't find.

    "raw_markdown": "![Two red paintings](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-060323-5.jpeg)\n\nAmy is a friend of me and [[Martha]], and a treasure of Portland's painting scene. Martha's been working at Nationale since we moved back, so we were both really stoked when Amy had a solo show there. Martha even had the pleasure of writing her exhibition statement.\n\nThe exhibition was a real knockout, especially if you've been following Amy's work for a while. Some of the pieces really felt like they'd been slowly growing for a long time, like the thickets of abundance they depicted. It felt a little like coming back to a familiar patch of forest or a trail after a couple seasons of growth. It's the place you remember, but you keep noticing evidence of the unseen force that animates it.\n\n[Here's the official documentation from Nationale](https://www.nationale.us/amy-bay-they-always-have-and-still-do-2023)\n\nAmy also gave a wonderful talk towards the end of the run of the show. She has a way of talking about her practice and the work of painting in general that is really refreshing and comfortable. It feels like she has done the work, loves the work, and has a healthy respect for the difficulty of it. And she's got the same sort of calm clarity of observation in how she talks about painting that she has in her visual depictions. So it was a good talk overall, but it was extra satisfying to hear her confirm and expand on some of the vibes I picked up. She and May (owner of Nationale) joked about the arc of changes for certain paintings between studio visits, and ended up pointing out some specific formal qualities that were new in this show.\n\n![Amy Speaking at the show](/assets/always-have-still-do/always-have-still-do-070623.jpeg)\nThat was something really satisfying that reminds me what's valuable about close looking or listening to artists talk about their work or good criticism or even just doing a little more research than swiping through images on Instagram. Like, that new-growth feeling I had was very present but hard to describe -- remarkable but ineffable. And I suppose I could have sat down with documentation of Amy's previous work and done some degree of comparative cataloguing and come up with some formal qualities that describe the differences. But that's not how we usually engage with paintings, and even when people have paid me to do that in writing it can take an unwieldy amount of time to get anywhere with it.\n\nBut when Amy was like \"yeah this might be the first painting of mine with a horizon line\" or pointed out that there's a semi-intentional diptych in the show, or talked at length about the mysterious insistence of the dark flower in the center of one of the most striking pieces -- those are some of those really rewarding moments of taking art seriously. I don't need everything noticeable to be explainable, but when you hear someone articulate the thing you noticed, that you keep thinking about but not in words, it's like this bridge between parts of your brain that I feel like we're generally discouraged from connecting. \n\n::::\n\nI thought I was going to write about the surfaces of these paintings more, but maybe I'll do that another time. (Which makes me think of the thesis of [[Patterns of Intention]].) Amy does really cool stuff with cold wax medium, scumbling, and very thin washes of color that makes these rich surfaces that feel organic while remaining very much just paint. \n\n\n\ncheck out the gallery here: [[They Always Have and Still Do]]",

    "raw_markdown": "**About this year's design**\n\nI (and I suspect many of you) have a small drawer full of rocks that I picked up because they [caught my eye](https://www.theonion.com/rock-looked-way-cooler-wet-1846863122) when I was somewhere I really enjoyed being -- a hike, or a seashore, or a special time and place. Each one at the moment seemed so remarkable and sharply in focus that I knew I would always remember the moment I got it whenever I picked it up again. Why blemish the experience with taking out my phone to get picture of it in its environment?\n\nSo, yeah, of course I don't remember where most of these rocks are from. But I love them! I remember many places they *could* be from, and trying to remember is pretty fun. \n\nI have added them to the paper cut so *you too* can imagine where this cool rock came from, remembering times you too might have seen a cool rock.\n\nSome rocks I *can* account for, though. The rocks in the corner are smoky quartz, given to us by a friend's mom (who also makes [tinctures](https://www.tinctureoftimellc.com/) after our studio got broken into multiple times last year. She said we should put one in each corner of our new studio for protection. Not sure if it's working, but [no break-ins so far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSVqLHghLpw).\n\nOtherwise, I've gone a little more traditional than usual with this cut. It's based on the \"woodland\" style wycinanki. While researching it, I learned that one of the original ways wycinanki were displayed were to paste them up all over your cottage. \n\nThe two trees in the design are based off two amazing trees that, until recently, lived in our neighborhood. The snowstorm we just had in Portland had some high winds, and we lost a bunch of trees. One was an enormous tree that towered over Belmont Street, and another was a gorgeous willow in the Lone Fir Cemetery.\n\nThe two cats at the bottom are our two cats, [Frankenstein and Elvira](https://www.instagram.com/frankensteinandelvira/). Are they playing or fighting? Yes.\n\nAs ever, I hope to be better at correspondence this year. To that end I started a newsletter, [Big Table](https://buttondown.email/nim/archive/). If you're getting this, I have probably forcibly signed you up for it, but it goes to spam a lot so perhaps this is all news to you.\n\nHere's hoping this finds you well and that your year will, in fact, rock.\n\nhearts for eyes emoji,\n\nn",

    "raw_markdown": "[[Chris Herdt]] spontaneously sent me these beans, which wereroasted in Minneapolis, where he lives, because he loves this roast and thought I would enjoy it, coffee fiend that I am. \n\nBy some chance eddy in the tides of coffee tastes and production, I had not one but two bags of some of the [[Lao Xu Zhai Yunnan Natural|Yunnan beans]] from *our* local roaster in Portland when it arrived. I believe they've made two or three roasts with Chinese beans. Martha and I first encountered Chinese coffee while we were in Japan, and it was quite good, but these are *excellent.*\n\nThis is the fourth or fifth bean from China I've tasted, I don't think I can describe the dimensions of what I'm starting to see as a shared character of Chinese beans, or at least those from the regions I've tried. Thinking about it, I'm inspired to dig out the sketch of \"tea space\" that I made years ago when I tried keeping a tea journal. It was one of the more ambitious attempts to translate, in detail, a synesthetic experience, in this case that of drinking good tea. And, as it happens, a lot of the tea I was drinking at the time was from China. \"Tea space\" was like this lenticular space with multiple dimensions for the colors, spacial qualities, actual flavors, and associated tonalities that were part of the experience of drinking tea for me.\n\nThis is a honey process, and I had a hunch about it that I told Chris. There's something, like, elastic and smooth about the flavor of Yunnan beans, like a shade of red used for a lolipop or a sports car from the 90s. If I had a \"coffee space\" diagram, these bouyant-but-deep [[Urs]] would be located close to the deep, dank well of chtonic flavors that come out of the more ambitious and strange beans I've had, mostly thanks to Push x Pull and Brandywine. Some of those are honey processed, others are co-ferments, and the standout, or at least the original that caught my attention was the Corazon de Jesus, which had been described to me by one of the baristas as resembling the flavor of a pineapple that had been left out for just a day or two too long, and *he was right.* My first shot of that was one of the most radical coffee experiences I've had. \n\nI told Chris I suspected that these beans would land somewhere between those and the other Chinese roasts I've had, but I don't think the \"pineapple\" descriptor translated well. This is where a Coffee Space diagram would help, because I'm sure he was thinking about the \"pineapple flavor\" part of \"pineapple\", which is bright, yellow, tangy, and sharp, but the qualities we're talking about here are rich, warm, and funky, but only through a sort of sublimation through the fruity top notes.\n\nAnyway, I was mostly right. I'm drinking it now. It's fantastic, and has that bouyant fermenty sense of a funky honey process, but some lighter, herbal midrange, and I absolutely understand the impulse to grab one of the last bags available and send it to a friend who is into coffee enough to, well, write this. Thanks Chris, this was a hit. Maybe I'll send you some beans in return.",

The hearts are under partial cover, and an almost-ring of gold also provides partial cover. Our two cats, Frankenstein and Elvira, have taught me a lot about the importance of partial cover. You can see more than you can be seen, you're protected but ready to pounce or GTFO, and if things are chill, you can take a nap.\n\nIn all that's happened and happening and going to happen, I wish for all of us to have our own cozy, buffered zone of partial cover where our gold parts can shine and our two weird birds can smooch over a heart on some flowers in a cage. \n\n**Bonuses:**\n\n[I made a timelapse showing part of the making of this papercut!](https://www.mmmx.cloud/media/interdependence-day-papercuts/interdependence-day-2025-timelapse-mp4)\n\nOn the topic of community and small, protected spaces to put art and nice things, [I'm helping some friends get off Instagram and you are invited too.](https://www.mmmx.cloud/instead-of-instagram)",

I’m glad to have avoided developing a <em>need</em> for things to be categorized accurately and completely, because nothing ever is, but I’m always looking for a bit more room in definitions, and noting which things overlap with which and where the mental threads connect. And sometimes (most times) one thing is like another thing, but only in a certain way. How are you supposed to put everything into rows and columns? Tags are such a good solution to this. You can add one, or a thousand, and you don’t even need to know what else they apply to yet.  They’re a facet of something. Everything is always facets. This is the road to galaxy braining, and it starts from anywhere and everywhere.</p>\n"
