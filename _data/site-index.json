[[Corby]] ran it for years and always let me work there when I ended up back in Ann Arbor for some dumb reason or another as a 20-something. After he passed away, Africa Schuamann, who had been manager for a while, really took over and <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2023/08/new-owner-of-dawn-treader-continues-legacy-for-longtime-ann-arbor-book-shop.html?outputType=amp\">eventually bought the place</a>. She’s really done right by the place, including replacing the awful florescent lights with classy pendant lights. She was also the one who let us in to the basement to rescue Corby’s years of rude collages.</p>\n",
