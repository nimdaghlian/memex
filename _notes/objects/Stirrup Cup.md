![A strange black cup with an iron elephant upside down at the bottom](/assets/notes/stirrup-cup.jpeg)



I got this at Tip Top Vintage. It's what's known as a "[stirrup cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirrup_cup)." The base is an iron elephant head and the rest is black glass, making it really quite heavy. It's great for drinking scotch whisky and plotting the overthrow of nations.
