> While that definition—software for group interaction—cuts across existing categories, I think it is the right one, because it recognizes the fundamentally social nature of the problem. Groups are a runtime effect.You cannot specify in advance what any given group will do, and so you can’t instantiate in software everything you expect to have happen.
