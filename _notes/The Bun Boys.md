We named them Business Bun and Cozy Bun because one of them got right down to business and left the nest when whey got too fat to fit, and the other one stayed cozy for an extra couple of days, which is a long time when you're three weeks old.

Business bun is perched on the nest here, while Cozy is still snuggled inside it.
