Chris does many things, including biking around Minneosta, internet security, running [Osric](https://osric.com/), and is the patron saint of pointless projects, for which I shall always venerate him. Chris has taught me many things over the years, as he's been putting up with me since I was 14. Crucial things include:

- you can just run your own zine
- you can also just invent a fake Chzech artist to sign linocuts you make
- the term "making biscuits" for cats
- that it's `public_html` and not `public underscore html`
- what ouzo is and what it does to a human

[He recently invented JACODA](https://osric.com/jacoda/).
