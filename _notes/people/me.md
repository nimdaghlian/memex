Hi I'm [NÃ­m](http://nimdaghlian.com).


I made this memex.

I'm married to [[Martha]]. We live in [[neighborhood| the Buckman neighborhood of Portland.]]

Our cats are [Frankenstein Minidisc and Elvira Blu-ray](https://www.instagram.com/frankensteinandelvira/)

Here are some of my paintings

[[Nik]] and I made hashtags for the regular websites called [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es){:target="_blank"} You can see them at work on this site!

I make music as Municipal Xylophone.

I make websites as the [Idea Store](https://ideastore.dev/){:target="_blank"}.

I don't use social media much but you can find me on [Mastodon](https://xoxo.zone/@nim){:target="_blank"} and, regrettably, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nimdaghlian/){:target="_blank"}.

My newsletter is called Big Table and I invite you to it!
