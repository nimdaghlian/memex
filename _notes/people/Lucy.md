[Lucy](https://lucybellwood.com/) is well-known as a natural force of positive energy. We sat next to each other at a button-making workshop at XOXO, talked about iPad screen protectors, and then later she friggin looked up conceptual labor from my actual paper business card, read it, and mentioned it on her blog! That's someone who does their research! 

We've been friends ever since our first breathless mindmeld about the nature of creative work being curious pens and papers blah blah blah. We once had a long phone call while I hung out in the middle of a big rope playground structure, which is kind of how I think about the space where our conversations happen. Lucy is great.
