"Memex" is a portmanteau of "memory expansion," coined by Vannevar Bush in his essay [As We May Think.](https://archive.org/details/as-we-may-think/page/n1/mode/2up) It's an early vision of how information technology could expand the human memory and serve its curiosity and inquiry.

Instead of getting that, we live in a world of Zunes (the GoBots of iPods), Vine (the Hydrox of TikToks), Threads (the Zunes of Twitters), and X (The Chris Gaines of actual Twitter).

So, at various points, people, myself included, keep trying to build memexes or things like memexes or just some way to feel like there's a [space for your brain on the internet](cozyweb).

The core idea here is to make a sort of mental storehouse, made as digitally sustainable as possible -- built on open source standards and software, simple enough that I can just get it out the door and use it and resistant to being remotely shut off by a billionaire.
