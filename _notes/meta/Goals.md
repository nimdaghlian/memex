I've made enough progress fiddling with how this site works that it's starting to take shape, and I've been meaning to track the decisions and work that have gone into that shape. I've never released a plugin or a theme or really anything publically, but some of this work is heading in that direction. That's kinda exciting to me, but who knows if I'll ever make the push to wrap it all up to be publically-usable. In any case, this is a record of the work I'm doing.

## Project summary

**Plan**

I want to experiment with ways the digital garden format can fasciliate thoughtful browsing and reading, not just writing. The digital garden I imagine would continously sprout with entries for external content that could be easily integrated into the digital-garden way of writing, annotating, and connecting ideas and writing. In the short term, I just want a "front page of the internet" for me and my friends free from algorithms, ads, and hoo-ha.

**Along the way**

This led to working on how to integrate the concept of "collections" into the digital garden way. I think that's a big part of working with and thinking about linked text -- using terms not as as single points, but doors leading to a stream of information linked to that term. None of this is very fancy so far. We're talking photo galleries, and pages that collect individual tags.

**Vaporware dreams**

[[Nik|Nik Wise]] and I are working on the world's 10-billionth implementation of tags and 10-millionth implementation of backlinks, which we're calling [[octothorpethoughts|Octothorpes]]. Why? I want to sit down with my garden's notes, connect my writing to my research, connect to my friends and their work, and not  be dependent on a particular app or even "go online." I'll write more about it if we get further down that road.
