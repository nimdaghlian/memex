<em class="page_hilight">MMMX.<i class="las la-cloud page_hilight"></i></em>, pronounced "mem ex dot cloud" is my semi-public [memex](/what-is-a-memex). It includes things I think are worth remembering, brain mulch, mind things, collections, and various notes. I try to put things on here that would be interesting to other people, but no promises. ðŸ’™ [NÃ­m](/me)


## Browse

There are a few types of things on here: 

- [Galleries](/galleries), which are collections of media
- [Media](/media), which are descriptive pages for a single piece of media, like an image or an audio track
- [Notes](/notes), which can be kinda anything they want

The things here tend to fall into categories. Here's a current list:
{% include catcloud.html  %}

<br>

You can browse by tag too:
{% include tagcloud.html  %}

It's always growing, but in all directions at once. My newsletter, Big Table, features recent highlights. I have a few RSS feeds you can follow:

- [everything](/feed.xml)

## More

This page is a [collection](/category/collection) of notes related to this site or memexes in general, so if you're still curious, there's more to read below and when I add something else relevant it'll show up here too.
