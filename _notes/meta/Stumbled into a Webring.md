Ok, so maybe the old, small web has some juice left in it.

Here I am writing a short essay about why I'm building a memex in 2023, and the enshittification of search engines made it very hard to find the [popular essay](https://runyourown.social/) that inspired me to start a private social network in the pandemic. I know I bookmarked it, I vaguely remember the name of the (seemingly awesome) [person that wrote it](https://friend.camp/@darius), but mostly the colors not the words of his name. Searching confronted me with the ongoing enshittification of search at the moment -- even Duck Duck Go was brimming with chum and generative clickbait-feeling stuff about boosting brand engagement. I almost gave up but the last result on the page of one search, as I was clicking away from it, had a name on it that tripped a sub-verbal set of associations that made me click through, and I found myself looking at this:

Not only was it the right link, it was on a... regular personal website but it looked basically like what I thought all websites should look like 20 years ago (and tbh still do), built with thing I currently prefer to make websites with.

And, uhh, it's part of a...webring? [The Public Interest Tech Webring](https://pitwebring.billhunt.dev/)?

It's moments like these that remind me that maybe my first thought when I find little patches of thriving native plants in the corners of Online monoculture shouldn't be "how long until this disappears?" and instead just enjoy the clicking.

Like, ok I just went back to those links turns out I'm looking at the blog of one of the bigger proponents of modern [webrings](https://billhunt.dev/blog/2022/12/30/bringing-webrings-back/)!

This is like the time I started writing about why I was making a digital garden and ended up discovering the gemini protocol >> [[About Gardening This Garden]]
