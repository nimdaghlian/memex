![A walnut side table](/assets/notes/sidetable-1.jpeg)My dad made this! It's a copy of a table that I found at a garage sale, but in this case the copy is way better than the original, which was plywood and also broken. I have a feeling that it was designed as smoker's furniture, but it's pretty good writer's furniture. Fits notebooks and one pencil quite well. I added the felt top, which is regular walnut on the reverse.
