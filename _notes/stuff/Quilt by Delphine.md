![Delphine's Quilt](/assets/notes/delphines-blanket.jpeg)

[[Delphine]] makes excellent clothing, including [conversational sweaters](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0R1ySDLscq/). She gave us this beautiful quilt, made with offcuts from many of her clothings, for our wedding. It was quite a surprise and one of our favorite presents. We were told that there was one patch that was JNCOs and tried very hard to find it but eventually had to ask for the answer. It was this one -- the stipe of denim in the middle there.
