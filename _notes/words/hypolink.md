definition: "an association that either makes sense at first but not after thinking about it, or one that doesn't make sense at first but kinda feels right after you sit with it."

Once in the early days of the Infobahn, [[Jon]] and I were in a conversation where somone waxed poetic about how hyperlinks are like how the mind works, connecting concepts and terms, and Jon uttered the "Jon noise" -- a sort of warble of equal parts elation and confusion and acceptence -- and said "I feel like my brain is mainly hyPOlinks"

Not that it needs a strict definition, but I'd say it's something like "an association that either makes sense at first but not after thinking about it, or one that doesn't make sense at first but kinda feels right after you sit with it."
