### Some analogies

In computer science, the idea of a "[word](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)>)" is defined as "the natural unit of data used by a particular [processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") design". So that's one way to think about it.

Or you could think of it as a more fine-grained version of "vibes," one that has specific meaning to you even if you can't articulate it.
