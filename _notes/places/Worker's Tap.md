[The Worker's Tap](https://workerstap.com/) is basically our extra living room. It's a worker-owned anarchist socialist lefty everything bar run by and frequented by the nicest people. We've played DnD there about a million times. They let me have my birthday there, and when [[Mykle]] and [[Jon]] and I got stuck in the middle of the World Naked Bike Ride by Michael's Italian Beef*, they let me come in and order a beer as long as I had "something covering my lower half."


`*` We were next to [the sandwich place too](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g52024-d487873-Reviews-Michael_s_Italian_Beef_Sausage_Co-Portland_Oregon.html)
