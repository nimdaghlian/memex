In May of 2021, we moved to a new neighborhood on the north side of Ann Arbor. Around the corner from our apartment lives a magical tree -- the Record Tree. In the warmer months, you are sure to find a pile of records, springing up from its roots like toadstools.

### Sounds of the Record Tree: Vol 1

![Cover for the Sounds of the Record Tree Volume 1 mixtape drawn by Martha Daghlian](/images/sotrt/sotrt-v1-cover.jpg)


This is the first mixtape I have made to highlight the gems that reward those who will dig through the Record Tree's sundry produce. Given the (growing) stack of sometimes-muddy records I have brought home from it, it won't be the last. Cover by [Martha](http://athousandcirclets.garden).
