ðŸŽ‰ Interdependence Day ðŸŽ‰ is my made-up holiday in which I make a gift to send to all of my friends, as a way of saying hi at least once a year â€“ a semi-meditative, semi-stressful practice to spend hours remembering the people I care about. I've been doing it since the early 2000s, making a range of choices about what constitutes a "gift" or what people "want." I've mostly settled on making papercuts inspired by the [Polish art of Wycinanki](https://www.polartcenter.com/Wycinanki-Paper-Cuts-s/169.htm), but you'll find a few other inventions here as well.
