Hello friends,

You are invited to an informal group show-and-tell at my studio on January 15 from 6:30-9pm. It's like a potluck, but for your mind! This will be very simple and low-key -- if you want to participate, bring something that you made, or found interesting, or just think is cool that other people should know about. It doesn't have to be new or rare or amazing as long as you can explain why it's remarkable or dear enough to you to share. A good book, a new project, a song, a weird stick. Whatever came to mind first when you read this invite. A modest A/V setup will be available.

We'll meet at the Big Table in the kitchen of 711 Studios and can use my studio down the hall if we need to. NA beverages will be provided. Friends are very welcome.

**When**
Thursday January 15 6:30 to 9pm

**Where**
711 SE Grand (above Mother Foucault's)

hope to see you there!

ps some of you may have noticed that this is on [Interdependence Day](https://www.mmmx.cloud/interdependence-day) and will be an IRL reboot of [Big Table](https://buttondown.com/nim/archive/)
