In high school, my buddy Pete and I thought we had it all figured out. We called each other in sick, pretending to be a doctor or a parent, and then we could play hookey. That all fell apart when I decided to call in as Dr. Merkin. The office called Pete's dad, and Pete's dad called me to chew me out. We didn't do that again.
