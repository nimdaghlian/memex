[[Lucy]] wrote about a [Real](/adas-three-kinds-of-things) [Mind Thing](/mind-things) of hers, [The Eggs](https://stone-soup.ghost.io/making-a-home-of-each-other/), for a very cool project called the [Personal Canons Cookbook.](https://stone-soup.ghost.io/archive/tag/personalcanonscookbook/)

This is such a lovely tale of friendship, more-than-friendship, shared meals, invented meals, and cohabitation in the most two-small-bears-in-a-den sort of way. Do read Lucy's tale. 
She says you can get the original recipe [here](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021034-chile-oil-fried-eggs-with-greens-and-yogurt).
