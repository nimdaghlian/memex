If  you wanted to attend the [first Make Radical Websites workshop](https://www.mmmx.cloud/rad-web) hosted at Virtua Gal but didn't make it in, good news! We're going to do it again.

We're going to cover the same material, and you'll still leave with your own website, but it turns out that material was *way* too much for one class. So we're splitting this up into three sessions over three weeks. The plan is to meet **Wednesdays from 5-7pm** at Virtua Gal from **April 9 to 23.** If you're able, we'd appreciate a donation from **$5-15 per class**. You won't be turned away if you can't afford this, but please donate if you can, as it will help make more events like this possible.

If you want to join, and can make it to all three classes, [please register here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/make-radical-websites-workshop-tickets-1271478358999?aff=oddtdtcreator). We got way more interest than we were able to accommodate for the original class, so please only register if you can make it, and let me know if you signed up but have to cancel. We're gonna cap it at 20 people this time, which is the max I think we can handle.

## Is this the start of the Lloyd Center Computing Club?

Maybe? I hope so? Based on the amount of interest from the first class, I'd like to find a way to make this an ongoing thing that offers more ways to participate.

Whether or not you can make it to the class, if you're interested in this kind of thing and learning more, sign up here:
