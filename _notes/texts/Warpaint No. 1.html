        &gt; Warpaint no. 1, Oil pastel on paper, 2023 &gt;</p>
        <p>This picture samples paintings about being at war, being a
        painter, and being a drunk. I plan to make more like it, and I
        ended up making it because I was led to it by a painting that
        samples paintings about death and revelry and imagined lands
        that I’m still working on. Immediately after finishing this
        picture, I started making drawings based on prepatory sketches
        for historical paintings and prints about apocalypse, madness,
        war, piousness, and dentistry.</p>
        <p>The left foot in this painting comes from one of the
        strangest and most unpleasant paintings I know of, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx#/media/File:Vrancx_Soldiers_Plundering.jpg">Soldiers
        Plundering a Farm</a> by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiaen_Vrancx">Sebastiaen
        Vrancx</a>, who was both an unremarkable soldier and an
        important painter.</p>

        <p>Certainly part of the reason it feels that way is because of
        how long I have looked at it, but you have to do that this
        painting. The strangeness reveals itself over time because so
        much is unintentional, accumulated, or sublimated.</p>
        <p>The painting, was made to have a <em>very</em> legible
        meaning. That you would look at it and see the villany of the
        soldiers as they maurauded the countryside under the lightest
        pretense that, at some point, they would fight in the war they
        were hired to fight, hopefully on the right side. Among the
        miliary scenes of Sebastiaen Vrancx, this painting stands out in
        its scale and plot. Rather than depicting the grand sweep of an
        important battle between consequential generals, we have an
        anonymous farmhouse belonging to civilians, possibly citizens of
        the same empires as some of the soldestka happily slaughtering
        them. And everyone looks more like a cartoon than anything in
        Vrancx’s paintings of war. It’s closer to his genre work, of
        daily life or allegorical scenes. The tendency of classical
        Dutch painters to depict humans as puglike wads of bleached
        flesh has always fascinated and disguested me. It’s like they
        are simultaneously criticizing humans for committing the crime
        of being alive and apologizing for their own complicity.</p>
        <p>This painting is a sitcom. Look at the set framing and even
        the lighting. Dutch painters at this time, including Vrancx,
        were <em>very</em> aware of optical perspective, but applied its
        rules selectively. This has none of the excruciating “accuracy”
        of a still life filled with the spoils of empire. Narrative
        distorted the lens, placed characters in explicable rather than
        physical space, removed the fourth wall of the set so the
        audience can see everyone doing all the significant things,
        wearing all the signifying articles of clothing.</p>
        <p>This painting is a cartoon. The colors, the edges, the level
        of detail. These are images to illustrate action. But for
        someone like Vrancx, a cartoon was a prepartory sketch, a
        diagram describing who goes where and what the edges of things
        are. To be more than that, to be a painting, he had to at least
        gesture at the incidental details of “realism” (a nonexistent
        term in the 1660s). The dull metallic sheen of the central
        soldier’s helmet, the logs of firewood stashed away in the
        rafters. Perhaps the model for the man about to be struck down
        was a local farmer Vrancx broke bread with. Maybe he was someone
        he killed or watched die during his time as a soldier, maybe he
        was made up from Vrancx’s own latent mental space of Dutch
        faces.</p>
        <p>There’s so much wrong and weird with this painting, but it
        still works. This happened, this is happening, this will happen
        again. How hard do we need to squint to see the official
        narrative, that to be a soldier means this or that, that war is
        necessary? How long can we hold one eye shut with that in mind
        until we let go and just see a bunch of young unattached men
        with weapons, killing and plundering people who don’t have them
        because they were busy raising crops and children?</p>
        <p>And maybe it – the attempt to communicate horror – works
        better because it’s so blobby and awkward? I have no idea how
        this appears to a normal person – I’m at the point where the
        bawling toddler bawling, alone in the middle of incomprehensible
        chaos, has become my a reaction meme in my own mind for various
        tragedies, big and small.</p>
        <p>But I <em>think</em> the ugliness is part of what makes it
        work. The unfathomable unsexiness of it. The visual bluntness of
        the weapons, the soldier’s dark robes outlined as if being
        explained to a child. And, as modern viewers, all of that just
        runs headlong into the vague, historically freighted sense of
        this as old valuable “art”. It’s a Dutch painting by a famous
        painter from the 17th Century! How much more <em>art</em> can
        you get than that? We have to undress it, strip the period
        costumes and ineffably-specific aesthetic turns, and imagine
        that it once was a window into a way that humans lived, perhaps
        a very smudged one, but a window still. From our distance the
        whole aesthetic of its era blurs together, but if you’re looking
        at at the calm, well-lit rooms of Vermeer or the precise
        hedonism of Weenix, and you remember this painting, the
        toddler’s wail breaks the refined mood like a siren in the
        distance.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Vermeer, that’s the back leg. Vermeer’s (likely)
        actual use of actual optics gives <em>his</em> orange stocking
        not just a sublime luminosity, but also, you know, the shape of
        a human leg. And I say it’s his because it’s not just from his
        painting, but because it’s his own painting of his own leg in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Painting">The Art
        of Painting</a>.</p>
        <p><a

        <p>The domestic scene that painting depicts is about as far from
        the plundered farmhouse as you can get, conceptually, without
        leaving the Dutch “golden age” entirely. I wonder whose stocking
        cost more, and who paid for the one the soldier is wearing.</p>
        <p>And speaking of wailing toddlers, the black hat, pipe, hair,
        and ghost face are from Jan Steen. Specifically his painting, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_Old_Sing%2C_So_Pipe_the_Young_(Jan_Steen)">As
        the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young</a>, and specifically the <a
        href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/our-collection/artworks/169-as-the-old-sing-so-pipe-the-young/">earlier,
        smaller version</a>.</p>
        <p><a

        alt="As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young, preliminary version" /></a></p>
        <p>There’s another toddler in this milieu, swabbing up
        life-shaping trauma like his playmate in the farmhouse, but
        having a lot more fun as he does. He’s part of the “young” of
        the title – the impressionable youth, at risk from the merriment
        of the adults. Steen had a grand career of painting, with deep
        and experienced relish, rooms full of lowlifes having an
        excellent time doing everything they aren’t supposed to, usually
        putting himself right in the middle. His paintings are kind of
        anti-still-lives. Some nice objects that signify material wealth
        are getting absolutely thrashed in this very painting. Vrancx’s
        people look messed up, but like Vrancx was still trying. When
        Steen exaggerates a subject’s features for some lost aesthetic
        meaning, they look like a goddamn alien. He painted – and one
        would assume got paid for – an aspirational <a
        href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jan_Steen_-_Fantasy_Interior_with_Jan_Steen_and_the_Family_of_Gerrit_Schouten_-_Google_Art_ProjectFXD.jpg">interior
        scene of the family Gerrit Schouten</a>, the owner of the
        Elephant brewery, in which his daughters are so willowy they
        look like praying mantises in period dress. I often wonder how
        he was ever sober enough to paint.</p>
        <p>Generally, I’m averse to direct connections between the
        historical “meaning” of the paintings I’m looking at and the
        paintings I make because the temptation of “getting” it
        encourages you to look past the distortions. If any my paintings
        had a “point,” it would be what’s wrong with them when you
        compare them to the paintings they look like, not what’s
        “right.” There’s an engagement with paint-as-paint in still
        lives of this era that’s startlingly contemporary once you see
        it. Genre paintings, like the ones this picture has snipped
        pieces from, get distracted by plot and character. We can go
        from Vrancx to Vermeer to see the scope of how much
        <em>seeing</em> was considered important on the grand stage of
        life. And then, honking out an armpit fart version of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwBrR_G70RE"><em>Het
        Wilhelmus</em></a>, here comes Steen, the drunken master with
        his own 4 a.m. wisdom.</p>
        <p>Digging into these sitcom-cartoon-allegories full of fleshy,
        awkward people has built a dim, drafty theater in my mind. I’m
        sitting in the back of it, watching a play of manners in a
        language I don’t understand. Sometimes the sun will break
        through the window so realistically I feel the warmth and am
        suddenly aware of exactly how ripe the pears on the table are,
        the number of strands of hair out of place in the lead actress’s
        complex hairstyle. Sometimes soldiers or disease tear through
        and kill half the cast, and I can’t tell if the blood is real.
        The smell of old beer certainly is.</p>
        <p>I don’t understand how Steen, Vermeer, and Vrancx’s scenes
        all existed at the same time as part of the same way of life,
        just like I don’t understand exactly how to fit life as a
        painter into the world we currently have.</p>
