Lacking by the elegance and refinement of sushi, free of the "good recipes" of tapas, and void of the cachet of nouvelle-cuisine, Wushi is distinguished from other small-plate traditions by placing priority on the question “what do I want to put in my mouth” rather than the question “what should I put in my mouth”.  

Accommodating all traditions, ingredients, and opinions of what is edible, Wushi is founded **4 Basic principles** which are applied to a system of classification for maximum tastiness results. 

 
## The Principles of Wushi



1. Take food you like
2. Put it on top of, or inside, other food you like
3. If possible, include something that could make it taste weird, but ends up making it taste awesome.
4. Make it bite-sized, for optimal sharing and ballistics.

## The System of Wushi

Food and food-like items are divided into the following categories

* Headliner
* Ballast
* Pizzazz
* The Snug
* The Plank
* The Smooth
* The Sauce
* Sprinkles
