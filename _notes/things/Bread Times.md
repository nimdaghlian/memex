Discussing Bread Times is how [[Martha]] and I acknowledged the existence and importance of _times_. I think this was before we lived together, and _one_ of us was harshly shaming the _other_ after discovering a bag of dinner rolls in his kitchen that he had purchased for his own consumption.

The accused acknowledged the excess of this, but explained that, in a way, it's healthier. Because, though it was, objectively, a large quantity of refined carbs for one person to eat, it was fewer *bread times.*

The irony of this appeal is that it actually goes against the fully mature concept of *a time*. This was later acknowledged by the accused when he purchased a loaf of bread, which would provide more bread *times* over a smaller *quantity* of bread.

Sometimes you are hungry, and you need a certain amount of food. Sometimes you are in college, and you require a certain quantity of beer. But this is different than the desire for a *time.* The rise of high-quality non-alcoholic beverages is, I believe, and indicator of this. Sometimes -- often even -- you want a _beer time_ much more than you want a beer. Sometimes you want a snack _time_ more than you want a snack. Sometimes you want four times, but you are not hungry. That is ok. An awareness of _times_ as distinct from _amounts_ can liberate you from the tyranny of conventional consumption.
