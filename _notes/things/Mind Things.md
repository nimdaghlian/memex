A Mind Thing is something you reach for in your mind as part of how you understand the world. If it's all just a pile of Lego up there, (or [[urs]]) then Mind Things are pre-assembled chunks, whether they were deliberately created over painstaking study or just sort of glommed together coincidentally in the eddies of regular mental currents.

My idea of a Mind Thing is a less-romantic update of a well-loved mind thing I borrowed from Nabokov when I first read Ada when I was 16. 

See [[Ada's three kinds of things]]



Here's how I translate that to Mind Things

**Things:** Songs that feel like old friends. All the sources cited in [[The Conceptual Labor Book|The Conceptual Labor Book]]

**Real Things:** [[Pika's Place]]. [[Corby's Collages]].

**Ghost Things:** [[The Mole Diagram]]. [[The Three Kinds of Things]]. [[Urs]].


This is definitely somewhat of a departure from the original, far more romantic structure, but it's a version I've worked with in my mind for a long time now.

#### Things

Things are more commodity-like, atoms of experience, pretty readily transmitted. The remembering is in the collecting of them. These seem to be pretty well-served by existing tools, analog or digital, and more in line with traditional means of archiving.

#### Real Things

Real Things don't quite exist without the rememberer's touch, without some interpretation. Possibly they require a production step -- they must be gone out and got, encountered before they can be collected.

#### Ghost Things

Ghost Things are both the most real and unreal of things. I think they're a bit like the back of your head -- you need a mirror to see them and they never look quite right in the reflection, but without them your brain would fall out.

I don't feel that confident in any other description of them yet, so I'm gonna keep trying to use this as a mirror and see if that gets us anywhere.
