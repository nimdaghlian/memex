Because of [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es/), I saw that [[Nik]] posted about [Design and Crime](https://nikolas.ws/design-and-crime), so I'd like to post about [The Burglar's Guide to The City](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-burglar-s-guide-to-the-city-geoff-manaugh/10350254?ean=9780374117269), another great book about <octo-thorpe>architecture</octo-thorpe> and crime that my friend Stephanie turned me on to. Just finished it, very good. Hope you see this, <a href="https://nikolas.ws/is" rel="octo:octothorpes">Nik</a>!
