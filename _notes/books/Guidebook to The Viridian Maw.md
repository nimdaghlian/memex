The first in a series of self-published zines meant to stoke the imaginations of tabletop role players, [Forking Paths #1: Guidebook to the Viridian Maw](https://orbis-tertius.org/store/forking-paths-issue-1-print) has given me and my friends literally hundreds of hours of engaged, high-fantasy imagination time. Each issue in the series describes an original imaginary land with detailed descriptions of its history, features, and creatures, but loosely enough that it can be used to play in any system you want, or just read for enjoyment. The Viridian Maw itself is "an overgrown meteor crater, mutated and reshaped by fungal influence," and the illustrations are great. A treasured object.
