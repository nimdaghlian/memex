This is a post following up on a call I put out on Instagram volunteering to help anyone interested to get off of Instagram and onto something more open, with the hopes we could get a little crew together to seed a small network that could be fun enough to keep using. Because of a) everything and b) Meta's recent rollback of [moderation / attempt to cut its workforce in the shittiest way possible](https://bsky.app/profile/utopia-defer.red/post/3lfpzprwaic2v),  it seems like this is another moment where people are looking around for options. A few people I know are planning to leave the platform right now, so I want this to serve as a reference for them and when more ripples like that spread across Instagram. 


## The Goal

I'd love it if a handful of people I follow would actively post visual content to a non-Instagram service, and if they could each get one or two friends to join them.

I willingly use Instagram for two things: 1) brain-rotting meme garbage 2) seeing paintings and photos from friends and artists I admire. I very unwillingly use it to learn crucial information that people post to temporary, non-zoomable posts on the worst interface on earth.

## What I'll do to help

- Make this page to get you started
- Wrangle any momentum that may build
- Answer all your questions
- Track the progress here
- Post there too
- I'm not at the "will host a fediverse server" stage yet, so not that

## What you should do

- Read this, and then DM or email me questions.
- Recruit friends.

## Two Good, Visually-Focused Options

My personal suggestion is that you either use  [Are.na](https://www.are.na/) or [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), or. These are two very different options, and neither one is perfect. Everything here is very much my personal opinion, written for friends. 

### [Are.na](https://www.are.na/)

Arena is sort of its own beast, but it's very focused on visual posts. It's both a way to share content and save it for yourself. You could think of it as a Pinterest for hip contemporary artists and designers who go to the kind of cafes that I'm typing this in. I have an Are.na account, but rarely use it. However, knowing almost no one on there, I still find really good stuff whenever I'm on there.

Pros: 
- Excellent content
 - lots of interesting accounts, like [Cari](https://cari.institute/)
 - has an app

Cons:
- Limited free version, then $7 a month
- In my opinion, an unnecessarily confusing UI and structure

## Pixelfed

Pixelfed is basically Instagram on the [Fediverse](https://buffer.com/resources/fediverse-beginners-guide/). You join an independently-operated server, and you get a handle that's @something.independent-server-name.com. But it can connect to other accounts on the Fediverse, even if they are on other servers. That means Mastodon, which looks like Twitter, can connect to Pixelfed, which looks like Instagram. Threads (mostly) works on the Fediverse, so if you have people posting on Threads you want to follow, you can *probably* follow them from your own Pixelfed account.

Pros:
- Free
- Federated, so the network might grow
- Very instagrammy
- There are ways to cross-post to different services

Cons:
- kinda confusing to set up
- the cross-post methods can be *very* nerdy and technical
- the Fediverse can seem pretty empty and geeky if you don't have a lot of friends there


> ### Why not [Cara?](https://cara.app/explore) 
> I'm not confident in its stability. There's a lot to love there, and the people working on it (I've met some) seem to be really great, but it's currently a volunteer project, and we've had some heartbreaking failures of wonderful projects (like Cohost) in the independent web space, so I'm concerned by their lack of runway.

## Other options

- BlueSky! It feels more and more like twitter, which I'm not sure is great, but [I'm on there.](https://bsky.app/profile/niiiiim.bsky.social) It's also technically Federated, but in a much, much earlier stage of doing that kind of thing.
- Tumblr. It's still there. [I'm on there](https://www.tumblr.com/flarmbt), kind of. It's a closed platform, but less... terrible? Pretty sure the owner of Wordpress will destroy it eventually.
## Some background on me and why I think small steps like these are important

This section is mostly for anyone who might have found this who doesn't already know me.

I'm not an open-source purist, but I'm pretty high on the nerd scale compared to average. (Maybe half of this site is written in markdown on a 12-year-old Thinkpad running Peppermint Linux, and the rest is on my M1 Macbook.) I build a lot of small sites, and have run a few small social networks for friends, including a self-hosted forum and a Discords, and have run or participated in small-to-medium sized research, critique, and art groups IRL. I've also been doing a lot of work in the small / open web space this year because of [Octothorpes](https://ideastore.dev/blog/octothorpes-public-beta/), and I got very, very lucky [to go to the last XOXO festival](https://www.mmmx.cloud/after-xoxo) where "how can we fix the fucking networks" was the hot topic. I highly, *highly* recommend [reading / watching Erin Kissane's](https://erinkissane.com/xoxo) talk she gave at XOXO. 

Much like Erin says in her talk, I'm not suggesting we can escape the network of friends and resources that are, for the moment, captured by closed platforms like Instagram just by using "better technology." But the more I go looking for healthy alternatives, the more there are to find. Watching Mastodon before and after the big Twitter exodus was instructive. It's not earthshaking, but better networks are possible. 

My from-the-heart advice is start a stinkin blog and use Octothorpes so my RSS reader will fill up with joy every day, but, well, baby steps.
